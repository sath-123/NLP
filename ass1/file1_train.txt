 the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred
 at present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was the head quarters
" "now i have got some news for you," said lydia, as they sat down to table
 but i can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and i dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise
" elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them
 on both sides it was only assertion
 he heard her with astonishment

 she felt that she had no business at pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it

 she talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, "now, i do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr collins and me have a little conversation together
 i was never more annoyed! the insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people! what would i give to hear your strictures on them!" "your conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you
 lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly
" however little Mr darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer

 Mr bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements
 well, any friend of Mr bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him
 as a clergyman, moreover, i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch
 "Mr collins," said she, "speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, i suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman
 a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter
 lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs bennet
 his fear of her, has always operated, i know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh, which i am certain he has very much at heart
 if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one
" catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to london
 "lizzy," said he, "i was going to look for you; come into my room
 for your sake," turning to charlotte, "i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line
 she was ashamed to think how much
 jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that  she would not give into it
 catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort
 "'tis too much!" she added, "by far too much
 with respect to wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr darcy afterwards discharged
" "no governess! how was that possible? five daughters brought up at home without a governess! i never heard of such a thing
 had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it

" "i see no occasion for that
 had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you
" "i deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried elizabeth; "i am  not a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things
 the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by  him
 wickham's affection for lydia, was just what elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to lydia's for him

 she wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "this must be false! this cannot be! this must be the grossest falsehood!" and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again
 when alone with elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject
-"i, who have prided myself on my discernment! i, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust
 if, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's, i can only say that i am sorry
 it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills
 we have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady catherine de bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye
" this was not very consoling to Mrs bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before, "i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate
 and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail? we cannot suppose he would help it, if he could
 Mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction
" "have you any idea, lizzy, who this gentleman is? but now it comes out
" Mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then added, "may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr and Mrs collins well
" "that is very true," replied elizabeth, "and i could easily forgive  his pride, if he had not mortified  mine
 the first week of their return was soon gone
 "come here, child," cried her father as she appeared
 it is natural that obligation should be felt, and if i could  feel gratitude, i would now thank you
 having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report
 if Mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?" "because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it
 it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure

 Mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family; jane heard them with horror

" "perfectly so i thank you
 she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr darcy that Mr darcy might leave the country, but that  he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week
 Mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance
 my feelings in every respect forbid it

 putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said, "i did not know before that you ever walked this way
" "and of your infliction," cried elizabeth with energy
" she would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, "oh! Mr bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar
 elizabeth was now to see Mr wickham for the last time
 from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr collins's side, and as many bows on sir william's, they departed
 most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other
 but, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference
 she was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when miss bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with
 many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man
 how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine
 but she is nothing to me now
 their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets; and jane more especially, who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had  she been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure
 she was met in the vestibule by lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "i am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! what do you think has happened this morning? Mr collins has made an offer to lizzy, and she will not have him
" "i did not know before," continued bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character
 she wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject
 lord! how i should like to be married before any of you; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls
 lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that  he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter

 "but it is fortunate," thought she, "that i have something to wish for

" she paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse
 to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment
 every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable
" "my dear Mr bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother

 allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety

" his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to netherfield
 " you began the evening well, charlotte," said Mrs bennet with civil self command to miss lucas
 these are conditions, which, considering every thing, i had no hesitation in complying with, as far as i thought myself privileged, for you
" on his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said, "did not you think, Mr darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton?" "with great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic

 at such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband
 i wonder what he can be doing there
 jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr darcy's looks and behaviour

 Mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection

 thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where i assure you there are many amiable young women
" elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed

 his anxiety for jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others

 miss de bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes

 one has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it
 miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men

 elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal
 she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable
 in short, my dear aunt, i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted, or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? all that i can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry
 chapter xix
" elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match
" Mrs bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of  her, in spite of all miss bingley's witticisms on  fine  eyes

 when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both
 lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs bennet's sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away

 elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship
 but when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition

" "to be sure, lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as wickham; or rather he has not wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good
 the morrow produced no abatement of Mrs bennet's ill humour or ill health

 but she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity

 the ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse
 i rather wonder now at your knowing  any
 and is  such a girl to be my nephew's sister? is  her husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother? heaven and earth! of what are you thinking? are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted?" "you can  now have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered
  your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of ignorance
 there was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake
 Mr hurst and Mr bingley were at piquet, and Mrs hurst was observing their game
 elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation

 having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so
" "i am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly
" "you are not going to introduce yourself to Mr darcy?" "indeed i am
 elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's

 i was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him
 his sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion
" the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share
 she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange
 but there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, i had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me

 Mrs bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again

 the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic
 not these two or three years perhaps
 they were in - street
 "what do you mean, Mr bennet, by talking in this way? you promised me to  insist upon her marrying him
" elizabeth was distressed
 he had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it
 he and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london
 lydia was lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless

" "that is very true," said elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me before
 it could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself
 i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection
 i hope your plans in favour of the  shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood
 but bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own
  that is all settled
 he delighted in going to pemberley, especially when he was least expected
 my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this
 she read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes
 their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr darcy was attending them to their carriage, miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress
 "your friend performs delightfully;" he continued after a pause, on seeing bingley join the group;-"and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr darcy
 had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps
 i congratulate her
" "yes, sir, i know i am

 "i am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she
 can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? oh! no
" she found that she was to receive no other answer and, after a short pause, added, "i think i have understood that Mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again?" "i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future
 in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour
 "while mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr bingley
" "your attendance upon her, has been too much for you
" "my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents
 every park has its beauty and its prospects; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh
 well, much good may it do them! and so, i suppose, they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead
 "oh! lizzy, why am i thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! if i could but see  you as happy! if there  were but such another man for you!" "if you were to give me forty such men, i never could be so happy as you

 she was shewn into the breakfast parlour, where all but jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise
 the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent
" elizabeth felt herself completely taken in
" "did Mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference?" "i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady
" miss bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room
 the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen
 he is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women
 she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct
 perhaps he thought her too young
 on their being joined by Mr bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery
 do not let us quarrel about the past
" "it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first
 but it ended in nothing, and i will not be sent on a fool's errand again
 when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small
 the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly
" "it is more than i engage for, i assure you

 in this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away
 he looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man, asked her how she had liked him
" "but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied darcy
 she will follow wherever lydia leads
 my father, however, is partial to Mr wickham
" "i dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age
" "may i ask to what these questions tend?" "merely to the illustration of  your character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity
 "not yet," replied jane
" "what sort of a girl is miss darcy?" he shook his head
 i can recal nothing worse
 she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters
" "yes," replied darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but  that was only when i first knew her, for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance
 but these, i suppose, are precisely what you are without
 her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it
 elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley
 from the farther disadvantage of lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going
 she cared for none of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of leaving wickham
 he arranges the business just as he pleases
" "can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?" "yes
 i expected to find a more reasonable young woman
" "their conduct has been such," replied elizabeth, "as neither you, nor i, nor any body, can ever forget
 i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but i was over ruled, as i always am
 what a contrast between him and his friend! Mr darcy danced only once with Mrs hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party
 elizabeth had settled it that Mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning
 my dear lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us
 while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible
 how wonderfully these sort of things occur! who would have thought of my meeting with perhapsa nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly! i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before
 the only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter
 as they passed through the hall, lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on
 but of every other neglect i can believe him capable
 the evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and elizabeth
 jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way
 "this is an evening of wonders, indeed! and so, darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! so much the better
 promise me, therefore, to come to hunsford
 how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd! yet it did, and even a third
" "i have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face
" elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse woman, walking was her only alternative

" "it  is wonderful," replied wickham,-"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend

 every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected
 the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen
 she could think only of her letter
" "lady catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour
 her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank
 vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?" Mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply, "do not make yourself uneasy, my love
 lydia, my love, ring the bell
 she is all affability and condescension, and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over
 wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish
 and yet, upon my honour, i believed what i said of myself to be true, and i believe it at this moment

" "the  present always occupies you in such scenes does it?" said he, with a look of doubt
" "oh! shocking!" cried miss bingley

 and his behaviour, so strikingly altered, what could it mean? that he should even speak to her was amazing! but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting
 my temper would perhaps be called resentful
 had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? they could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same
" "but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about
" a long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter
 this, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, i hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr wickham
 every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch
 it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling
 how could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been
 but is it certain, absolutely certain?" "oh yes! they left brighton together on sunday night, and were traced almost to london, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to scotland
 she remembered also, that till the netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son
 Mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at netherfield
" kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry
 in as short a time as Mr collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness
 amongst the most violent against him was Mrs bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters
" "true; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room
 she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr philips's
 "i can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?" "i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation
 if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs long
 it became her turn to listen
 elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it
 such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr bingley's continued absence
 but above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked
 i did not expect such a compliment
 they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her, "so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham! your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old wickham, the late Mr darcy's steward
 the colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken
 "she is my youngest girl but one
 "come, darcy," said he, "i must have you dance
 never, even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield, or his dignified relations at rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings
" "i must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied jane, "and i hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together
 she answered him with cold civility
" "and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself? does he know his real character?" "i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did
Number
 soon after you left me on saturday, i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were
" "to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either
 had she not seen him in derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there  with his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it
 by the author of "sense and sensibility
 the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea
 and one of my own daughters
" "and what arts did he use to separate them?" "he did not talk to me of his own arts," said fitzwilliam smiling
 lady catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable

 "i am by no means of opinion, i assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her
 he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr darcy had been staying there
 chapter xii
 but before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her
" in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone
 had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable
 we must have Mrs long and the gouldings soon
" the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret
 she is almost three and twenty! lord, how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty! my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think
" her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation
 so, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next
 "who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?" "his misfortunes!" repeated darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed
 she tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance
 elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more
" "i do not believe a word of it, my dear
 wickham passed all his youth there, you know
 the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth
 pray do not talk of that odious man
 as for myself, it is many, many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner
 but jane and elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished
 to the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others
 he was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in derbyshire
 if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least
 widely different was the effect of a second perusal
" "how i long to see her again! i never met with anybody who delighted me so much
" and with these words he hastily left the room, and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house
 dearest lizzy, i hardly know what i would write, but i have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed
 let me do it without farther loss of time
 miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty
" "to oblige you, i would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him, i should only think worse of her understanding, than i now do of her heart
 she dreaded seeing wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible
 Mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, &c
 i am always glad to get a young person well placed out
 it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now
 within doors there was lady catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day
 her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious
 "my dear father, i congratulate you
" "let her be called down
 she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country
 "they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! it would be such a delicious scheme, and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all
" "how can you talk so?" said jane faintly smiling,-"you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, i could not hesitate
" "oh! my dear," cried his wife, "i cannot bear to hear that mentioned
" "certainly," he replied, biting his lips
 you must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much
 elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it
 he was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments
 my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room
" "after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match
 bingley was by no means deficient, but darcy was clever
 "your's sincerely, &c
 "for my own part," she rejoined, "i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her
" "and do you impute it to either of those?" "yes; to the last
 "she is a great deal too ill to be moved
 his father, miss bennet, the late Mr darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be in company with this Mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections
 he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear
 in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master; she comes here to morrow with him
 lydia was a stout, well grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age
 in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage
 "and this is always the way with him," she added
 against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged jane to borrow Mr bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made
 "yours, &c
 in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him
 there was no arguing upon such a project
" "i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever
Number
 Mrs bennet was quite disconcerted
 i have met with two instances lately; one i will not mention; the other is charlotte's marriage
 will you be very angry with me, my dear lizzy, if i take this opportunity of saying (what i was never bold enough to say before) how much i like him
 the garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving
 well! i am so happy
 "you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, i am sure, to oblige us for one half hour
 an hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to longbourn
 "i am going to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows
 you must send john with the young ladies, Mrs collins
 elizabeth looked expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know i am married to day? i was afraid they might not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle, so i was determined he should know it, and so i let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then i bowed and smiled like any thing
 her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield, to longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire
 but her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands
 her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness
 but nothing can be done; i know very well that nothing can be done

 nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant
 i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr darcy
 his affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend
 hope was over, entirely over; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort
 as for jane,  her anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to

 she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him
 what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? as a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship! how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! how much of good or evil must be done by him! every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression

 they were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others

 * * * * * "good gracious!" cried Mrs bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley! what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? i had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company
 they were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs bennet and kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what elizabeth felt
 that they might have met without ill consequence, is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger
 Mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card

 but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice

 the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced

 "i told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr darcy; and you, yourself, when last at longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him

 but, alas! the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question
 "as soon as ever Mr bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs bennet, "you will wait on him of course

 he was her dear wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him
 she longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr bingley for his kindness to jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy

 elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem
 Mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour, till sir william thus began
 he then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else
 but when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding

 not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr darcy returned within the stated time
 such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! it is really too distressing
 elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame

 in her kind schemes for elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam

 if you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment

" "and so ended his affection," said elizabeth impatiently
 it was generally evident whenever they met, that he  did admire her; and to  her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent
" "you mistake me, my dear
 and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection
 while in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh? are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?" "yes, and i had heard it before
 but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to brighton

 and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married
 "there were some very strong objections against the lady," were colonel fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in london

 but really, ma'am, i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early
" "indeed, mama, you are mistaken," said elizabeth, blushing for her mother
 one day's delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual
 she watched him whenever they were at rosings, and whenever he came to hunsford; but without much success
 she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations
 how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters i cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr collins too! why should  he have it more than anybody else?" "i leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr bennet
" elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself
" "but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham
 every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight

 he has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing
 there is a lady, it seems, a Mrs younge, who was some time ago governess to miss darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what
 you are to understand, miss bennet, that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will i be dissuaded from it
" elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit
" this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss bingley
 but he is an ugly fellow! i am glad he is gone
 she resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family
 "where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door
 lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her
 the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place, that she might be farther from the door
" "and what is your success?" she shook her head
 for though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body
 miss darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side
 five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs bennet, for many years after lydia's birth, had been certain that he would
 miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former
 kitty stared at him, and lydia exclaimed
 a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little
 and who knows what  may happen? but that is nothing to us
 what an agreeable man sir william is, Mr bingley is not he? so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy! he has always something to say to every body
 and then when we came away it was such fun! i thought we never should have got into the coach
 at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration
 and then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it
 but he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not
" "oh! thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!" cried elizabeth when she had finished it
" "oh!" said lydia stoutly, "i am not afraid; for though i  am the youngest, i'm the tallest
" "aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if i had known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one
 lady catherine, sir william, and Mr and Mrs collins sat down to quadrille; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs jenkinson to make up her party
" "neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance
 "then, who taught you? who attended to you? without a governess you must have been neglected
" "true
 but i will not repine
 i certainly  have had my share of beauty, but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now

 elizabeth could but just  affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it
 far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter
 not all that Mrs bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr bingley
 but now it was all too natural
 it is what every body says
 i had often seen him in love before
 my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me
 besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the  shire have left meryton, and they are going in a fortnight
 i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me  that
" Mr darcy's letter to lady catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr bennet sent to Mr collins, in reply to his last
 on the very day of my coming home from longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor
 Mrs gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends
 "lady catherine de bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living
 it was then disclosed in the following manner
 did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in kent?" "i  have heard from authority, which i thought  as  good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron
 "they have both," said she, "been deceived, i dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea
 it pains me to offend you
 i have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare
" "and your assurance of it, i suppose, carried immediate conviction to him
 in the hall they parted
 it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do
 the world has been deceived in that respect; and i am happy to say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune
 had lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned
" "we are not in a way to know  what Mr bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit
" sir william only smiled
 she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers
 chapter xix
 though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness

 elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt
 darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it
" "speak to lizzy about it yourself
 every girl in, or near meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished  her by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites
 on being made acquainted with the present Mr darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard Mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill natured boy
 she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class
" "aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself
 balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters
 it was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried
 but let me advise you to think better of it
 i have done with you from this very day
 are you going much farther?" "no, i should have turned in a moment
 but however he did not
 could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections? to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?" elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said, "you are mistaken, Mr darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner
 he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while
 only let me assure you, my dear miss elizabeth, that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage
 but don't imagine it was from any silly cause
 she is grown so brown and coarse! louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again
" "i am not now to learn," replied Mr collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time
" the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while
 in the intervals of her discourse with Mrs collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl
 "i hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother inlaw a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers
-"oh! Mr collins!"- "my dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point
 in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew  more affection than she feels
" "you saw me dance at meryton, i believe, sir
 miss bingley was engrossed by Mr darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her
 she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal
 people  did say, you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but, however, i hope it is not true
 her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them
 almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life
 her reflections were in general satisfactory
 miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte, and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself
 she was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition
" elizabeth made no answer
 the envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages
 Mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room
 as her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence
 it was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours
 elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband
 i need not explain myself farther; and though  we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable
 respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown

 and with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former  were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn
 for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter
 i defy even sir william lucas himself, to produce a more valuable son inlaw
 Mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,- "this walk is not wide enough for our party
" then addressing her daughter, "oh! my dear, dear jane, i am so happy! i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night
" "i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time
 the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice
 even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away
" "oh! if that is all, i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better
 she accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn, had by some accident been lost
 i do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain
" "Mr collins moreover adds," "i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known
" "that is right
 painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled
 he then said, "i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly

 "kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room
 your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather
" their party in the dining room was large, for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her
" "heaven forbid!- that would be the greatest misfortune of all! to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! do not wish me such an evil
 "i am, dear sir, &c
 what could be the meaning of it? it was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know

 Mr collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed

 he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia, to send any message to her
 of Mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find
" "i desire you will do no such thing

" "your first position is false
 i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior
 i am very, very sorry
 i will have no reserves from  you
 from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how  he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce
 after wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation
" "pride," observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing i believe

" "and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?" "how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right
 it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome
 you have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule

 her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is

 elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane, on their first arrival at lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere
" "you are then resolved to have him?" "i have said no such thing
 with a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations
 i wish you had been there
 let me hear from you very soon
 we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect
 it was agreed to
" "Mr darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried elizabeth
" "i believe her to be both in a great degree," replied wickham; "i have not seen her for many years, but i very well remember that i never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent
 she stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent
 i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here
" but of this answer lydia heard not a word
 i shall be back by dinner
" jane shook her head
" "how strange!" cried elizabeth
 Mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old
 it is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions
 it is impossible that he should still love me
" "impossible, Mr bennet, impossible, when i am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?" "i honour your circumspection
 jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again
 lady catherine rose also, and they turned back
 as she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr darcy, and Mr darcy only, entered the room
 elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom
 bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied
 well, i was so frightened i did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day
 about the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon
 you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it

 at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and i spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer
 no, never
" "though it is difficult," said jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit
 i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield
 he absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility
 colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings
" "you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which i have never acknowledged
 in the absence of jane, he always attached himself to elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of relief
 it is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining
 by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration
 his affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her
 but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice
 i really cannot  laugh at it

" elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room
 but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham
 i was in the middle before i knew that i  had begun
 they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene
 long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided
 elizabeth now began to revive
 but on returning to the drawing room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her
 Mr wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat a salutation which Mr darcy just deigned to return
 to the little town of lambton, the scene of Mrs gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of lambton, elizabeth found from her aunt, that pemberley was situated
 but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you

 elizabeth was disgusted, and even miss bennet was shocked
 caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did i receive in the mean time
" "she is a very fine looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well
 it is every way horrible!" darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence
 four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister

 "it is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me
 the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay
" "you are mistaken
" "when i wrote that letter," replied darcy, "i believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit
 her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill judged thing in the world! how strange must it appear to him! in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! oh! why did she come? or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage
 upon the whole, i am much pleased with him
 Mrs bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual
 elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied
 they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world

" "i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject
" and rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr collins thus addressed her, "when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character
 i am perfectly serious in my refusal
 i quite detest the man
 he has been accused of many faults at different times; but  this is the true one
 i shall never forget her appearance this morning
 her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her
" "not as you represent it
 the present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from  that, though elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of darcy, she could have borne the dread of lydia's infamy somewhat better
 she complained bitterly of all this to her husband
 Mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them
 miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard
 she is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but i will  make her know it
 she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs
" elizabeth turned away to hide a smile
 there was no want of discourse
 "indeed, Mr bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that i should be forced to make way for  her, and live to see her take my place in it!" "my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts
 it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night

 upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward
 the rest of the evening passed with the  appearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again
 darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence
 he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest
 the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic
 lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention
 Mr collins was eloquent in her praise
 you see on what a footing we are
 their powers of conversation were considerable
 but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was
" "did you go by the village of kympton?" "i do not recollect that we did
 at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here
 i rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal
 Mrs hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr darcy's eyes were fixed on her
 the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend
 to my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men
 there are few people whom i really love, and still fewer of whom i think well
 my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of of Mr wickham
 oh! how acutely did she now feel it
 on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place
 he had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage
 bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable
 charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding, "i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility
 when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence
 "i began to be afraid you would never come back again
 they talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs gardiner thought of him, and Mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject
 why jane you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see Mr bingley
 your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from Mr wickham
 she had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible
 Mrs bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of
 you are all to come to pemberley at christmas
 she was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when
 wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in london, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her
 "i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas
 Mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character
 "so, lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love i find
 her look and manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and i remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment
 you tear them to pieces
 their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves
 the other is miss de bourgh
 but we considered it, we talked of it as impossible
 Mrs collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home
" but jane could think with certainty on only one point, that Mr bingley, if he  had  been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public
 he, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry
 remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin
 they have some of the finest woods in the country
 he still loves me, and we are engaged
 the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment
 i see the imprudence of it
 the gardiners staid a week at longbourn; and what with the philipses, the lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement
" on miss lucas's persevering, however, she added, "very well; if it must be so, it must
Number
 "it certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr bennet, "and nothing can clear Mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn
" but Mr gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters
 jane was distressed
 you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite
 kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for Mr collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton
" this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away
 i was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her
 in understanding darcy was the superior
" "my dear jane!" exclaimed elizabeth, "you are too good
 it is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side
 bingley was the principal spokesman, and miss bennet the principal object
 i must confess myself surprised by your application; i did not expect it from  you
 "i should like to know how he behaves among strangers
 she got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour
 but you have chosen your fault well
 in a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account
" elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together
 oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!" "oh! my dear," continued Mrs bennet, "i am quite delighted with him
" the girls stared at their father
 she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage
 i will take care of myself, and of Mr wickham too
 "nay," said elizabeth, "this is not fair
 i am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs f
 i do not know the particulars, but i know very well that Mr darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way
" chapter xiii
" "who do you mean, my dear? i know of nobody that is coming i am sure, unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in, and i hope  my dinners are good enough for her
 every thing nourishes what is strong already
 that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible
 and you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner
" "her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament
 i cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago
 lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end
 she was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation
 every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane
" "oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption! and, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road
 if your feelings are still what they were last april, tell me so at once
 i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are packed up
 i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday
 their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party
 i always said it must be so, at last
 she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty
 it is a pity they are not handsome! not that  i think charlotte so  very plain but then she is our particular friend
 he had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than  we had; and the consciousness of this, was another reason for his resolving to follow us
 you alluded to something else
 a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible
 he is gone to my father already
" the gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where miss bennet was making tea, and elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair
 elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "i have never had a cross word from him in my life, and i have known him ever since he was four years old
 you know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends
 "i am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper i ever met with
 i thought too ill of him, to invite him to pemberley, or admit his society in town
" "you shall have it in few words
 yes, yes
 " you want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it
 there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care
" "i have already told her so once, by your desire
 stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all
 are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?" "oh, yes! you will only think i feel  more than i ought to do, when i tell you all
 but the case is this
 colonel forster came yesterday, having left brighton the day before, not many hours after the express
 his revenge would have been complete indeed
 it does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours
 they were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them
 the suspicions which had just arisen of Mr darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love
 this was very amiable, but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of Mr collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself
 tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure
 much as i respect them, i believe, i thought only of  you
 let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied
 a scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation
 Mr darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings
" "do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?" "sometimes
 and in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away
" "that is to say, you had given your permission
 the fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention
 a lively imagination soon settled it all
" "it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them
" "what, none of you?" "not one
 as it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery
 well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr stone
 jane was by no means better
 Mr wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could
 he was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting
 she will be down in a moment i dare say
 her power was sinking; every thing  must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace
" "she did indeed, louisa
" elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion
" elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate
 Number
 yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête àtête was over
" Mr darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter
 "i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried jane
" it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened
 by Mrs hurst and miss bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments
 could she have seen half as much love in Mr darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes
" miss bennet still looked all amazement
 when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous
 "if i," said Mr collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman
 on this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared
 the others have been gone on to scarborough, these three weeks
 "there is also one other person in the party," he continued after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you, will you allow me, or do i ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton?" the surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it
 for herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him
 they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family
 "how despicably have i acted!" she cried
 your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable
 "could i expect it to be otherwise!" said she
 i cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family
" "it did
 and what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?" "she is a most charming young lady indeed
 these causes must be stated, though briefly
 i am confident that she would have performed delightfully
" "yes; i do comprehend a great deal in it
 miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings
 i was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit
 it was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them
 i am perfectly satisfied
 i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children
 but why Mr darcy came so often to the parsonage, it was more difficult to understand
 when she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my sister inlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away
 she knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour
 some people call him proud; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it
 at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner
 chapter xi
 elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "lord, how tired i am!" accompanied by a violent yawn
 she had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome
 he repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence
 when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her having two men servants go with her
 he looked serious as usual; and she thought, more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at pemberley
 they agreed that Mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together
" "but my father cannot
 "how near it may be to  mine, i cannot pretend to say
 it was all conjecture
 it was to this effect: "since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well
 but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising
 i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow
 there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him
 elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly

 the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right

 she was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness
 i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge
 i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister
" "i did not think you would; and that being the case, i cannot consider your situation with much compassion
 i should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire
 elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr darcy and herself
 she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr wickham, and rejoiced in it
 you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken
 "i have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak
 the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each
 elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes
 she had ventured only one glance at darcy
" "no why should he? if it was not allowable for him to gain  my affections, because i had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?" "but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event
" "has she been presented? i do not remember her name among the ladies at court
" "i am grieved, indeed," cried darcy; "grieved shocked
 but she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife
 it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in london, than in scotland
 her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy
" "miss bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be
 it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy
" "ah!" cried Mrs bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls
" "and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason

 his friend had left him that morning for london, but was to return home in ten days time
 miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other
" Mr gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from colonel forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send
 it was really a very handsome thought
 Mr collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels
 she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater what shall i call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough

 her ease and good spirits increased

 he bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr darcy, with an expression of half laughing alarm
 "if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield," said Mrs bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, i shall have nothing to wish for
 when at length they arose to take leave, Mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation
 "and pray may i ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "is it in address that he improves? has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style? for i dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials

 "they will join me early to morrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you, Mr bingley and his sisters
 Mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required
 elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough
 i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you
 you see how continually we are engaged there
 but, lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or jane at most

 elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said, "you mean to frighten me, Mr darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? but i will not be alarmed though your sister  does play so well
 his reception however was of the most flattering kind
 it was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return

 her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much
 elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to miss darcy, without calling her attention
 it was very little less
" "all! what, all five out at once? very odd! and you only the second

 it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind
 let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest
 when she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away, i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer

 neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach
 Mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many
 he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him, till after the departure of the former
 Mr bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him

" miss bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives
 the two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification
" "her daughter, miss de bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates
 we live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her

 elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter
 after tea, Mr bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and mary went up stairs to her instrument

 it was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till easter day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening
 my faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! but perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design
" "thank you but i always mend my own
" "but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take pemberley for a kind of model
 "this fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend
 he was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty
 but there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure
 elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and even jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when if they had gone to scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them
 "yes, she called yesterday with her father
; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them
 jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out, "oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?" "yes, i have had a letter from him by express
 she was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her
Number or Number
 the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street
 he spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride
" "oh! i am not at all afraid of her dying
 Mr bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before
 he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information
 elizabeth felt jane's pleasure
" Mrs gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation
 elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain
 that she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection
 allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear miss eliza, (glancing at her sister and bingley,) shall take place
 Mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless
 it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast
" "ah! you do not know what i suffer
 when Mrs bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before
" "his manners are very different from his cousin's
 that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible
 * * * * * in the evening, soon after Mr bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme
 you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one
 i am very glad you liked her
 but he is a liberal master, i suppose, and  that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue
 he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant
 as all conversation was thereby at an end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the room
 if i had ever learnt, i should have been a great proficient
 her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way
 but my dear lydia, i don't at all like your going such a way off
 i am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but i hardly know what i have written
 Mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast
 miss lucas is married and settled
 he bore it however with admirable calmness
" elizabeth shook her head over this letter
 they repulsed every attempt of Mrs bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr collins, who was complimenting Mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests
 when Mr bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure
 Mrs gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder
 there is nothing else to be done
 it was as follows: "my dear sir, "i feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire
 they all paint tables, cover skreens and net purses

 let me mend it for you
 and if you will stay another  month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london, for i am going there early in june, for a week; and as dawson does not object to the barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, i should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large
 but these things happen so often! a young man, such as you describe Mr bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent
 elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it
 Mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both
" "you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society; and indeed i am quite of your opinion
" my mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at easter, i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis de bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england

" "you have a house in town, i conclude?" Mr darcy bowed
 "well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband? is not he a charming man? i am sure my sisters must all envy me

 let us flatter ourselves that  i may be the survivor
 she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs hurst and miss bingley
 "she looks sickly and cross
 her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth, as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable
 Mrs gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late Mr darcy by character perfectly well
 but i must write no more
 elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little
 "no; but it must be done soon
 that had his actions been what wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr bingley, was incomprehensible
 "oh! my dear lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?" "oh, lord! i don't know
 we were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary
 i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent

 "haye park might do," said she, "if the gouldings would quit it, or the great house at stoke, if the drawing room were larger; but ashworth is too far off! i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for purvis lodge, the attics are dreadful
 anxiety on jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr darcy's explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what jane had lost
 at length however Mrs bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken
 lydia was exceedingly fond of him
 and as i come back, i can call on lady lucas and Mrs long
" with a stronger voice she soon added, "i have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself
" "that is exactly what i should have supposed of you," said elizabeth
 it was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush
 but i hope you will not mind it: it is all for jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then

 the pause was to elizabeth's feelings dreadful
 when the party broke up, lydia returned with Mrs forster to meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning
 by all that i have ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary
 my dear, dear lydia! how merry we shall be together when we meet!" her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr gardiner's behaviour laid them all under
 "what will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are! he takes them now for people of fashion
 i was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance
 the note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with
 "it was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as his marriage was fixed on
 our poor mother is sadly grieved
" elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately
 having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity
" "are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?" " i never saw such a woman
 "about a month ago i received this letter, and about a fortnight ago i answered it, for i thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention
" "oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both
_ dear sir, the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since i have had the misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance
 he was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it
 if you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence
" "i dare say you believed it; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity
 such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined
 the consequence of it is, that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have, and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever
" "but," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him
 she is not such a simpleton
 i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me
 she says lizzy had better have taken Mr collins; but  i do not think there would have been any fun in it
 elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply
 she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation
 a younger son, you know, must be inured to self denial and dependence
 "dear sir, "i must trouble you once more for congratulations
" the effect was immediate
 while these newly born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing
 elizabeth could not help saying, "it is very much to his credit, i am sure, that you should think so
 pemberley was now georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see
 what he means to do, i am sure i know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening

" the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued, "you look conscious
" bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business

" Mr wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's
 "my dearest lizzy will, i am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expence, when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me
 thank heaven! i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him
 she had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance
 "read it aloud," said their father, "for i hardly know myself what it is about
 i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn
 Mr bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his

" "but, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood
 "it is nothing in comparison of rosings, my lady, i dare say; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's
" "i should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother
 nothing could console and nothing appease her
 he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune
 i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner
 i hate such false friends
 the lucases are very artful people indeed, sister
 you could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine
 in that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction
 the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! he had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce
 here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind
 you are lucky in having such a master
 never, since reading jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her
 lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room
 a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern
" "do you suppose them to be in london?" "yes; where else can they be so well concealed?" "and lydia used to want to go to london," added kitty
" "oh! it is of no consequence
 it was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor
 are the others coming out?" "i do not know
" it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first
" "and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley
 they have a sharp, shrewish look, which i do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable
" "you are severe on us
 it cannot be concealed from any one
 elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect
 in confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on
" when lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short
 their table was superlatively stupid
 it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind
 she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings
" this letter gave elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least
" Mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters
" "i must not decide on my own performance

 it appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that i am strongly inclined to hope the best
 i am prodigiously proud of him
" "all this she must possess," added darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading
 yet he knew to the contrary himself
 we passed each other several times
 Mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed
 very little was said by either; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same
 such very superior dancing is not often seen
 and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the north
 had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility
 it was the second week in may, in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street, for the town of - in hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs
 nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states
 she was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial
 that he was really fond of jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations
 however, i did not hear above one word in ten, for i was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear wickham
  his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out, "what is that you are saying, fitzwilliam? what is it you are talking of? what are you telling miss bennet? let me hear what it is
 as they walked across the lawn towards the river, elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables
" nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance
 it was unpardonable
 it was a fortnight since Mrs bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high
 her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley, "i can guess the subject of your reverie
 could he expect that her friends would not step forward? could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to colonel forster? his temptation is not adequate to the risk
" "perhaps," said darcy, "i should have judged better, had i sought an introduction, but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers
 darcy took up a book; miss bingley did the same; and Mrs hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss bennet
 but however insincere  you may choose to be, you shall not find  me so
Number
 this match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place
 "my dear brother, "at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, i hope will give you satisfaction
" "it was a subject which they could not mention before me
 how grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family! when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful
" in spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it
 she could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended
 my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!" "oh! jane," cried elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?" "i do not know
 no one but jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation

 "my dear friend, "if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tête àtête between two women can never end without a quarrel
 i never was
 she was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, i am happy to add, that i owed the knowledge of it to herself
" elizabeth quietly answered "undoubtedly;" and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family
 "you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing
 a clear ten thousand per annum
" "no, no
-"i certainly saw Mr darcy speaking to her
 i must find Mr gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; i have not an instant to lose
 i do not wish to avoid the walk
" "nay, if you are so serious about it, i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled
 Mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me
 when the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party
 she did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that  she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile
 to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther
 had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?" as she pronounced these words, Mr darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued
 "can you come to morrow?" yes, he had no engagement at all for to morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity
 "i am sorry to hear  that; but why did not you tell me so before? if i had known as much this morning, i certainly would not have called on him
 it was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain
 however, i recollected afterwards, that if he  had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr darcy might have done as well
" to these high flown expressions, elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent Mr bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his
" "lady catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use
 lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten; every sister except mary agreed to go with her; and Mr collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at hunsford
" Mr collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter
 elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes
" "are you, indeed? and pray what sort of guardians do you make? does your charge give you much trouble? young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way
 it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago
 i knew it myself, as it was known to miss bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant of it
 the children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them, playing with them, and loving them
 Mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it
 "what could become of Mr bingley and jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of  their affairs
 you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night
" Mr gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was saturday
 you and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us
 all were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and kitty and lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot
 "this is wholly unexpected
 charles, when you build  your house, i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley
 while sir william was with them, Mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road
 excuse me for i must speak plainly
" "oh! your uncle! he keeps a man servant, does he? i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things
 he is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably
 mary and kitty were both with Mrs bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all
 many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if  he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia's connections, which is not likely, can i suppose her so lost to every thing? impossible
 he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before
 his behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father
 so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to  his easy temper, or  her affectionate heart
 i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, lizzy?" elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible
 when the ladies returned to the drawing room, there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted
 i do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and i am sure if i had been you, i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it
 Mr collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family
 and  that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter
" "oh, no!" said elizabeth
 but, however, he is very welcome to come to netherfield, if he likes it
 compliments always take  you by surprise, and  me never
 every thing being settled between  them, Mr darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home
 miss bingley i am sure cannot
 it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment
 but her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton, these visitors came

" without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first
" "she had better have stayed at home," cried elizabeth; "perhaps she  meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours
 "and of this place," thought she, "i might have been mistress! with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted! instead of viewing them as a stranger, i might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt
 she then joined them soon enough to see lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "ah! jane, i take your place now, and you must go lower, because i am a married woman
 i am truly glad, dearest lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock is over, shall i own that i long for your return? i am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient

 but such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited
 no principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with Mr darcy
 "in essentials, i believe, he is very much what he ever was
 "you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age
 within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate
 Mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet
" "no more have i," said Mr bennet; "and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you
 but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon
 Mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard
" the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well
 brother inlaw of wickham! every kind of pride must revolt from the connection
" jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness
 if i was to go through the world, i could not meet with a better
 elizabeth was not surprised at it, as jane had written the direction remarkably ill
 Mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield, in the course of three or four months
 they must all go to brighton
 their reception at home was most kind

" he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend
 don't think me angry, however, for i only mean to let you know, that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on  your side
 you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for  your approbation alone
e
 she saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family
 my youngest of all, is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man, who i believe will soon become a part of the family
 what congratulations will then flow in! i appeal to Mr darcy: but let me not interrupt you, sir
" "can you possibly guess, lizzy, who is meant by this?" "this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire, splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage
 they had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring
 it was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting  when she had seen him last in hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed, "how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november, Mr darcy! it must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, he went but the day before
 but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents
" "probably not; but Mr darcy can please where he chuses
" miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections
" he then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister
 she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley
 she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home
 she had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening
 but still he would be her husband
" elizabeth could not but look surprised
 i saw them the night before last
" "and yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand them
 he made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him
 your ladyship wants Mr darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished for promise, make  their marriage at all more probable? supposing him to be attached to me, would  my refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? allow me to say, lady catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged
 since the  shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head
 as for elizabeth, her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards  one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out
 miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with  them, was expressed towards the two eldest
 their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the collinses' reach

 they were off saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight
 the rain continued the whole evening without intermission; jane certainly could not come back
 Mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july, and must be in london again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than derbyshire

 poor charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion
 if, indeed, it should be so! but i dare not hope it
 elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last
 after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow jane to deceive herself no longer
 pray, what is your age?" "with three younger sisters grown up," replied elizabeth smiling, "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it
 she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who often joined them, and good naturedly engaged Mr collins's conversation to herself
 while settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her
" "his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said elizabeth angrily; "for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr darcy's steward, and of  that, i can assure you, he informed me himself
" "oh, yes
 his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear
 it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment
 Mr wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia
 i told Mrs collins so before you came
 "and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr gardiner
 when the ladies removed after dinner, elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared
 but jane was to go home with her, and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation
 there is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much

 "yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! i  will leave him to himself
 the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be
 on saturday he came again
 after walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home
 but my feelings are not only cordial towards  him; they are even impartial towards miss king
 there was no help for it however
 but do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr darcy?" "they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine
" "is it possible!" cried elizabeth, when she had finished
" "let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility
 elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her
 she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room
 and when you have given  your ball," she added, "i shall insist on their giving one also
 i only hope they may have half my good luck
 elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur
" "upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person
" "but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?" "it does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt
 but i am at his disposal
 besides, there was truth in his looks
 the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family
 Mr gardiner declared his willingness, and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation

 her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms
 elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation
" "not so hasty, if you please
 Mrs bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces
" "how can you contrive to write so even?" he was silent
 more thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed
 perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been  that in his voice, which was not like ease
 she put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success
 but there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good natured wishes for her well doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain
 "indeed, jane, you ought to believe me
 when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses

 her answer was warmly in his favour
" elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness
" his daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north, received at first an absolute negative
 that he was  surprised by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr gardiner
 from his garden, Mr collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while sir william accompanied him, charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help
" "but does lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand?" "oh, yes! that, that is the worst of all

 but here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet
 it was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go
 but before they heard again from Mr gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr collins; which, as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise
 i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least
" "no," replied jane, "i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you
 of what he has  particularly accused me i am ignorant; but of the truth of what i shall relate, i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity
 but now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in lydia's marriage
 Mr darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them
 resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment; and i trust i am resigned
 she would not betray her trust, i suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found
 it was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "say nothing of that
 that they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! oh, lydia!" "i comfort myself with thinking," replied jane, "that he certainly would not marry lydia, if he had not a real regard for her

 their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection
" and so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house
 the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas's last week; and even Mr darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least
" "i am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness

 he danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner
 every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr darcy, she could not but allow that Mr bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits

" and accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage together
 a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth; but at last on Mrs bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could not help saying, "oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him

 elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty

 she danced four dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times
 the first part of Mrs gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions

 her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little

 as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr collins's scruples of leaving Mr and Mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing room, that Mr wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house
 she was wild to be at home to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe
 gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection
 two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them
 if you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up
 "you are joking, lizzy
 i want to be told whether i ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham's character
 whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr collins, was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr bennet were dead
 who  could about such a nasty little freckled thing?" elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of  expression herself, the coarseness of the  sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal! as soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and lydia's purchases, were seated in it
 he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way
 we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton
 and so, my dear sister, i find from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen pemberley
 something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life
 perhaps i am not doing her justice
 the dejection was almost universal
 as soon as they entered the copse, lady catherine began in the following manner:- "you can be at no loss, miss bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither
" "but you see that jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt
" "i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party
 i will only say farther, that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection
 Mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party
 elizabeth was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes
 Number
 miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane
 "if i had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to brighton, with all my family,  this would not have happened; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her
" "to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it? it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum

" elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her
" Mr darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh
 in a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other
 however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters
 at that moment, she cared for no other
 Mrs collins will be very glad of your company, i am sure
 at present i will not say more, but perhaps when we are better  acquainted" he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other
 she retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse
 their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp
 such doings discomposed Mr bennet exceedingly
 had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself
" "did not you?  i did for you
 but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?" elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning
 do your sisters play and sing?" "one of them does
 such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them
 she certainly did not hate him
 it is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world
 miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr darcy's progress through  his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page
 on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband

 i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends, but of this hereafter
 of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough
 they shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super excellent disposition of jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself

 they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother
 i have faults enough, but they are not, i hope, of understanding
" "i might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? was not this some excuse for incivility, if i  was uncivil? but i have other provocations
 and then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!" to this, mary very gravely replied, "far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures
" her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than elizabeth
 it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr darcy's proposals
 if it be not so, let Mr darcy contradict it
 but the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me
" darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject
 his most particular friend, you see by jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her
 with the mention of derbyshire, there were many ideas connected
" elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet
 lady catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance
" "with all my heart; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it

" "i have no right to give  my opinion," said wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise

 his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit
 he enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done
 you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy
 the gentlemen did approach; and when Mr wickham walked into the room, elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration
 and when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; Mr bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man
 i am impatient to see him
 where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil
 i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters
 Mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else
 Mrs hurst thought the same, and added, "she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker

 Mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr bingley

 no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph
 i have not a doubt of your doing very well together
 but, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's
 elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the fairest way for happiness
 Mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on george wickham, who was his god son, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed
 since her father's death, her home has been london, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education
" "indeed you are mistaken
 the second began
 Mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world
 Mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane; but as he took up his abode with the lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs bennet
 "implacable resentment  is a shade in a character
 you wanted me, i know, to say 'yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt
 she saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once
 jane could have no reserves from elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world
 "how could i ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face
 his pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable, allowing something for fortune and figure
" "i thank you for my share of the favour," said elizabeth; "but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands
 that lady i suppose is your mother
 these parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not
 the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning; and Mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings
" "are they indeed?" cried elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction
 i pity, though i cannot help blaming her
 they look upon it quite as their own, i dare say, whenever that happens
 an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all
 "she is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration
 elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr darcy
" "i will not be interrupted
 she enquired after his sister, but could do no more
 "a gamester!" she cried
 they came
 to the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long
 from what he said of miss darcy, i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl
 "i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself
 my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying Mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did
 soon after their return, a letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and was opened immediately
 there is nothing he would not do for her
" "not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise
 but when the gentlemen entered, jane was no longer the first object
 i knew how it would be
 the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way
 the distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles
 during dinner, Mr bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness
 from something that he told me in our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him
 i am happier even than jane; she only smiles, i laugh
 "excuse my interference
 the letter was to this effect: "my dear lizzy, "i wish you joy
 but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley
 she was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr darcy and herself
 he knows where we live
 she felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained
" she could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success
 then, the two third he danced with miss king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the  boulanger" "if he had had any compassion for  me," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! for god's sake, say no more of his partners
 he placed himself by her
" lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said, "i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit
 in truth i must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings
 her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone
 my visit was not long, as caroline and Mrs hurst were going out
 after walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park
 but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed
 "very well
 the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield
 his arrival was soon known at the parsonage, for Mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence
 but self, though it would intrude, could not engross her
 a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love
" "yes, indeed," cried Mrs bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood
 but think no more of the letter
 he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem
" lydia declared herself satisfied
 and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless
" "good gracious! Mr darcy! and so it does i vow

 thank heaven! he has  some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves
" "no, nothing at all
 she is on her road somewhere, i dare say, and so passing through meryton, thought she might as well call on you
 i write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation, and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read
 you refuse, then, to oblige me
 the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of lady catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough
 when i am in company with him, i will not be wishing
 you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there  not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother's permission for this address
 when is your turn to come? you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane
 let me know every thing that i am to know, without delay
 allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr darcy
 when Mr collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten
 sir william lucas, and his daughter maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise
 but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving home

 miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps
 he who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister
 she seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her
" "yes, very well
 but if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away
" "the letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, i hope, quite so easily changed as that implies
 if  i can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too
 what a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received! he was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex

 they were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of pemberley might be something! they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned
 jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected
 it is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, i hope you will think of us
 miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her

 "he could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? if he fears me, why come hither? if he no longer cares for me, why silent? teazing, teazing, man! i will think no more about him
 bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, darcy was continually giving offence
 "what an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was shut
" this was invitation enough
 i am so pleased so happy
" "this is not to be borne
" to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female
 "i hope, my dear," said Mr bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to day, because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party
" lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was
 Mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary
 she could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress
 to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said, "i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal
 it was not all settled before monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to longbourn
 those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable
" "that is very strange
-"a gentleman and a stranger! it is Mr bingley i am sure
 my objections to the marriage were not merely those, which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me

 elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known sir william's too long
 Mrs gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on: "you are too sensible a girl, lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, i am not afraid of speaking openly
 i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me
 i could not have parted with you, my lizzy, to any one less worthy

 Mr philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before
 i told him, moreover, that i believed myself mistaken in supposing, as i had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, i felt no doubt of their happiness together
" she then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two
 she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia, and, removed from the influence of lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid
 bingley and jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them
" "very well

 the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more i think than last year
 he could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump
 lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over
" "if you believed it impossible to be true," said elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far
 "wickham so very bad! it is almost past belief
 "Mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he? poor eliza! to be only just  tolerable
 i thought i should have died
 he stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to elizabeth again, he walked away
 Mrs bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could
 it drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present
 as for your elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?" "it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied
 in a short time, i shall have a daughter married
 it soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before
" "this is quite shocking! he deserves to be publicly disgraced
 the whole of what elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter
 my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner, one, whom his father had promised to provide for
 the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!" she was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits

 but we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride

" "are you quite sure, ma'am? is not there a little mistake?" said jane

 between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again
 we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend, the certain evils of such a choice
 Mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope, that by the following christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office, another regiment should be quartered in meryton
 this letter is from Mr collins
 no aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy
 in making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self reproach
" "but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea
 but your  family owe me nothing
 you must contrive to send somebody
 not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated elopement
 it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week
 "his father was an excellent man," said Mrs gardiner
 it was hardly enough; but it pleased her
 their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy's
" "how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it! but i wonder how long you  would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself
 elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? catherine, weak spirited, irritable, and completely under lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and lydia, self willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing
 were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain
" "but if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required
 so imprudent a match on both sides! but i am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood
 intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done
 so far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great
" elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room
" another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment
 why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?" "why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear
 in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which jane was equally eager to satisfy
" but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year
" she was gone directly
 the prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits
 it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance
 my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me
 indeed, eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them
" "this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west
 lady catherine's great attentions to Mrs collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent
" "i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful
" jane then took it from her pocket book, and gave it to elizabeth
 though Mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage
 Mr collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way
 "that is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to  me to have many such acquaintance
" "i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself
 the moral will be perfectly fair
 you have employed your time much better
" "you know nothing of the matter
 we had better go into the avenue
 people do not die of little trifling colds
 there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters
" when the dancing recommenced, however, and darcy approached to claim her hand, charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence
 a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away
" "it may do very well for the others," replied Mr bingley; "but i am sure it will be too much for kitty
 Mr bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable
 the whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention
 in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme
 lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off
 i knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine, frankly and openly
 her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines
 she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery
 elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him
 it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected
 there could not exist in the world  two men, over whom Mr darcy could have such boundless influence
" "take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment
" "my dearest sister, now  be be serious
 i think i have heard you say that you know them

 he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her
 it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world
" "your surprise could not be greater than  mine in being noticed by you
 such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! oh, my dear lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before
 she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions
 but here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized
 it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of  some, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible
 a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of their  three months' acquaintance they had been intimate  two
 would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress
 but do not imagine that he is always here so often
 in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger
" she held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house
" "so much the better
 i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it; i believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as i wished it in reason
 oh, brother, how kind you are! i know you will contrive it all
 you must and shall be married by a special licence
 i must conclude, for i cannot be long from my poor mother

 if elizabeth, when Mr darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents

 it would be dreadful! she blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk

 lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but  he had never seen any thing but affability in her
" "la!" replied kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before
 "you have insulted me, in every possible method
 miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth
 the account of his connection with the pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words
 for my part, i am inclined to believe it all Mr darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse
 it is of all subjects my delight
 her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying, "there are very few people of whom so much can be said
 i know it cannot be long
 she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances: and to have Mr collins instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed
 her carriage remained at the door, and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it
 that is the place to get husbands
 the same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening
 elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from pemberley
" jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern
 "he only told me, what i have now told you
 no one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection
" her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the servants remained
" "she seems a very pleasant young woman," said bingley
 poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder
 he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true
 you may remember what i told you on that point, when first we talked of it
 the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and wickham, who happened to sit near elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies
 but that is one great difference between us
 the housekeeper came; a respectable looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her

" "already arisen!" repeated Mr bennet
 his consenting to marry her is a proof, i will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking
 he is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane
 i have told miss bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as i have often told her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the piano forte in Mrs jenkinson's room
 she comes to us to day
 she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr darcy
 i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies
 i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent

 she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken

 lydia the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern
 for a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path
 but are you pleased, jane? shall you like to have such a brother?" "very, very much
 this Mrs younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town
 "it taught me to hope," said he, "as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before
 miss darcy, the daughter of Mr darcy, of pemberley, and lady anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner
" "is this," thought elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "and pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger son? unless the elder brother is very sickly, i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds
 on the following monday, Mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn

 "and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! oh, that i knew how it was!" but wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour
 oh! that i had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone
 without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want
 "oh! my dear Mr bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball
 elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane, while Mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor
 here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell
 proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself
 had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort
 if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty
 elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement
 thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business
 "well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; i thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them
 jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever
 "he meant, i believe," replied jane, "to go to epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them
 he wrote last week to hurry my return
 in a few minutes, Mrs bennet half opened the door and called out, "lizzy, my dear, i want to speak with you
 the carriage was sent to meet them at -, and they were to return in it, by dinner time
 the evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary
 elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion
 "i should never have said Mrs collins was settled  near her family
 their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency
 he observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "it is above eight months
 multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets (example: m^{rs})
 i know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that i am not afraid of requesting it, though i have still something more to ask of the former
 from the entrance hall, of which Mr collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti chamber, to the room where lady catherine, her daughter, and Mrs jenkinson were sitting
 when her mother went up to her dressing room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication
 Mr denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps
 jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window she looked, she saw Mr darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister
 she had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years
 it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way
 but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment

 but  your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family
 "i am afraid, Mr darcy," observed miss bingley, in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes
 "i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter

 let me advise you then, my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence
 he simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all
 he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it
 when they had gained their own room, jane taking out the letter, said, "this is from caroline bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal
" "you are quite right
 and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton, of whom i shall subjoin a list, according to his information
 they walked towards the lucases, because kitty wished to call upon maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone
 she asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name? elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly
 lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so good humoured as lydia
 but this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr darcy walk into the room
 she was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr darcy, she was directly retreating
" "now, kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife
" "oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs bennet, "that is exactly what i could most wish for
 they then went away
 under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief
 "he is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle
" "i can much more easily believe Mr bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony
 she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her
 the favour of your company has been much felt, i assure you
" this accounted to elizabeth for Mr wickham's being among them
 sir william had been delighted with him
 she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance
 she followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly! "a man who has once been refused! how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!" she was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying, "is your sister at pemberley still?" "yes, she will remain there till christmas
 but will they make you happy?" "have you any other objection," said elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?" "none at all
 what did colonel forster say? had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place? they must have seen them together for ever

 they are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain
" "in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of
" miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection
 "i assure you there is quite as much of  that going on in the country as in town
 in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived
 i shall see her in january
e
 but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?" "will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?" "by all means," cried bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of
 that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of  some amiable feeling
" nothing that she could say, however, had any influence
 "i admire all my three sons inlaw highly," said he
 have you never happened to see her there?" she was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet
 elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room
 the marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants
 where shall you change horses? oh! bromley, of course
 and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november, for had it been otherwise, i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace
 i pity you, miss eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better
 his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn
 elizabeth was in agonies
 when he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr bennet to return to longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel
" "no," said her father, "wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds
" "depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them all
 on the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance
 if he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight
 who should suffer but myself? it has been my own doing, and i ought to feel it
 "i know not, miss elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it
 reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections
 to jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what jane felt for bingley
 she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either
" " that is his notion of christian forgiveness! the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive branch
" it was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from jane
 amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life
 they could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for Mr darcy
 but i will no longer importune my young cousin
 the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister
 to miss lydia bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing
 she could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man
 the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished
 if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law

 well, but now for my news: it is about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it? there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king
" "your humility, Mr bingley," said elizabeth, "must disarm reproof
 you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing

 i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!" "i have been used to consider poetry as the  food of love," said darcy
 he now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself, as well as of Mr darcy
 hear me in silence
" Mrs reynolds's respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master
 when they were all in the drawing room, the questions which elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give
" "well, and what news does it bring? good or bad?" "what is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it
 "can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated
 she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out
" "there is, i believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome
 on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book

 what a delightful library you have at pemberley, Mr darcy!" "it ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations
 her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming
 "do you certainly leave kent on saturday?" said she
 her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered
 pride & prejudice
 to the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer
 there could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body
 but, on second thoughts, perhaps lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person
 their visits to Mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence
 as soon as jane had read Mr gardiner's hope of lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance
 but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done
 it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy
 two days after Mr bennet's return, as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to miss bennet, "i beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so i took the liberty of coming to ask
 it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit
 "aye, there she comes," continued Mrs bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at york, provided she can have her own way
" "i believe, ma'am, i may safely promise you  never to dance with him
 it was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day
 she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together
 the sight of miss lucas was odious to her
" Mrs bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of bingley's behaviour to jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals
 she expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther
 will you tell me how long you have loved him?" "it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began
" "yes," replied wickham;-"his estate there is a noble one
 why should they try to influence him? they can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it
 only think of  that my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time

 we all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him

 the tumult of her mind was now painfully great
 the one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago
 i
 in lydia's imagination, a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness
 jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr darcy could be so unworthy of Mr bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham
 while the family were in this confusion, charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them

 but in spite of all this fine talking, my dear lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for  another  interest in the affair
 she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley's inattention
" elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat
 but i will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks
" "our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money
 what a fine thing for our girls!" "how so? how can it affect them?" "my dear Mr bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them
" he smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said
" "i have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as i generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage
 he then handed her in, maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings
" lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence
 jane looked well, and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them
 his behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire
 they are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families
 they have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression
 Mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr denny had brought him from london, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the  shire
 but i think Mr darcy improves on acquaintance
 all elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again

 what is your own opinion?" "that it ought not to be attempted
 he seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy
 his circumstances, he assured me, and i had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad
 Mrs wickham! how well it sounds
 family pride, and  filial pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this
 had it been your uncle's doing, i must and  would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way
 he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over
 "you are a good girl;" he replied, "and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled
 lady catherine observed, after dinner, that miss bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added, "but if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer
 but vanity, not love, has been my folly
 it was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane's attractions
 her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room, to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself
 to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her
 i remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well wisher and friend, william collins
 "what, is he coming home, and without poor lydia!" she cried
 but gracious me! i quite forgot! i ought not to have said a word about it
" from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr darcy had been over rated, elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs gardiner's long letter, but now, having  that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: "i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, i was too cross to write
 their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme

" elizabeth looked surprised
" elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce
 her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully
 it is useless to talk of it
 their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recal them

" "believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire
 "i am trying to make it out
 the farewell between herself and Mr wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more
 what he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer
 "how abominable! i wonder that the very pride of this Mr darcy has not made him just to you! if from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest, for dishonesty i must call it
 it is not that i do not believe  my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution
" " you observed it, Mr darcy, i am sure," said miss bingley; "and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see  your  sister make such an exhibition
 for my part, Mr bingley,  i always keep servants that can do their own work;  my daughters are brought up differently
 "i am sure," said she, "i cried for two days together when colonel millar's regiment went away
 the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball
 chapter i
 his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost
 she answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "when you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance
 she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct
" "he likes to have his own way very well," replied colonel fitzwilliam
 though darcy could never receive  him at pemberley, yet, for elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession

 if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach
" elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr wickham's attentions
 but tell me, what did you come down to netherfield for? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?" "my real purpose was to see  you, and to judge, if i could, whether i might ever hope to make you love me
 never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her
 my dear jane, Mr collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking
 the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence
 "i know little of the game, at present," said he, "but i shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of  life" Mrs philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason
 "only think of its being three months," she cried, "since i went away; it seems but a fortnight i declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time
 elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth
 "from the very beginning, from the first moment i may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry

 it originated in Mrs gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's
 very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family
" "if you were aware," said elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, i am sure you would judge differently in the affair
 when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible
 those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs forster called her, and they were going to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public
 she grew absolutely ashamed of herself
 her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted
 but his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited

 "i am glad i bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home
 "we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs gardiner, "but perhaps to the lakes
 but, really, i know not what to say
 your mother must have been quite a slave to your education
 she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who  did call on him in her return through london, and there relate her journey to longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which  she had refused to give
 as the day of his arrival drew near, "i begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said jane to her sister
 she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself
 you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you
" elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion
" "upon my word, sir," cried elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration

 "i never heard any thing so abominable

 he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, lydia's expences had been very little within that sum
 i am sure you will be very comfortable there
 if that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon
 jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved
 this was one point, with regard to lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him
 "i am sorry it went off

 in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could

 with many compliments to them, and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter, to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed, "good lord! sir william, how can you tell such a story? do not you know that Mr collins wants to marry lizzy?" nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but sir william's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy
 she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her

 Mr gardiner was a sensible, gentleman like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education
 his air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal
 Mr collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give

 Mr bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr darcy than he has received; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man
" "indeed!" cried wickham with a look which did not escape her
 after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr darcy, drawing near elizabeth, said to  her "do not you feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?" she smiled, but made no answer
 i should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing
" "that is as it happens
 what a good joke it will be! i can hardly write for laughing
 Mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight
 i will not spend  my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again
" and she rose as she spoke
 "it was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the  shire
 by this time she is actually with them! if such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! what a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!" "we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said jane: "i hope and trust they will yet be happy
 i suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers
 my brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart
 those who chose to be idle, certainly might
" elizabeth answered only by a slight bow
 "he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again
 he heard her attentively, and then said, "lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances
 i want to talk very seriously
" "miss bingley told me," said jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance
 the business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news
 elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made
 elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself
 Mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces
 you have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him
 that he was not a good tempered man, had been her firmest opinion
 i cannot blame myself for having done thus much
 she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion of her
 if  you have not been mistaken here,  i must have been in an error
 they are wanted in the farm, Mr bennet, are not they?" "they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them
c
 but no such recollection befriended her
 kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy
' are any of your younger sisters out, miss bennet?" "yes, ma'am, all
 oh! lizzy, to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall i bear so much happiness!" she then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with kitty
 my father supported him at school, and afterwards at cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education
 elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was
 in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go
 sir william staid only a week at hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with
 though her manner varied however, her determination never did
 but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion
 many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory
 this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part
 "very well and this offer of marriage you have refused?" "i have, sir
 he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me
 yours ever, "caroline bingley
" "that is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily
 the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this
 to elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence  had been self imposed
 miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense
 "i must ask whether you were surprised?" said elizabeth
 pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, i have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned
 they were not the only objects of Mr collins's admiration
 it is impossible
 you must not disappoint your father
 i shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance i require
 i cannot misunderstand you, but i intreat you, dear lizzy, not to pain me by thinking  that  person to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk
 her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil
 Mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner
 why was he to be the judge?" "you are rather disposed to call his interference officious?" "i do not see what right Mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy
 tell her that you insist upon her marrying him
" "would Mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?" "upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter, darcy must speak for himself
 Mr darcy was punctual in his return, and as lydia informed you, attended the wedding
 it was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture
 elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend
 but i have always observed, that they who are good natured when children, are good natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest tempered, most generous hearted, boy in the world
 "but it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded
 my good opinion once lost is lost for ever
 "what would she have said? how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself
" Mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer
 the invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine's drawing room
 "you begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her
 wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison
 "i wonder my aunt did not tell us of  that
" "dear lizzy!" "oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general
 mamma would like to go too of all things! only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!" "yes," thought elizabeth, " that would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once
 the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent
 "is it not clear enough? does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? can there be any other opinion on the subject?" "yes, there can; for mine is totally different
 "he is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners! so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!" "he is also handsome," replied elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can
 see paragraph Number
 he cannot know what Mr darcy is
 chapter ii
" "true," said Mr bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it
 elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants
 consider how important every moment is, in such a case
 having said thus much, i feel no doubt of your secrecy
 i dare say i shall soon see them here
 and do you really love him quite well enough? oh, lizzy! do any thing rather than marry without affection
" "i do assure you, sir, that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man
 the visit was returned in due form
 it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife
 the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances
 he was most highly esteemed by Mr darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend
 she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him
 Mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well
 and when i returned home, the  shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time
" "i certainly shall not
 bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends
 mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball
 but i ought to beg his pardon, for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant
 it was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention
 she read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again
 i was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that  you, that miss elizabeth bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr darcy
" "perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and Mr robinson; did not i mention it to you? Mr robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and  which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question oh! the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point
 she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room
 she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before
 at such a distance as  that, you know, things are strangely misrepresented
 the possibility of Mr collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two; but that charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out, "engaged to Mr collins! my dear charlotte, impossible!" the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied, "why should you be surprised, my dear eliza? do you think it incredible that Mr collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?" but elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness
 his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret
 the families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose
" charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth
 they now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought
 but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london
 as yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness
 she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power
 every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight
 he did not leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a gentleman had called on business
 "lizzy," said he, "what are you doing? are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? have not you always hated him?" how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr darcy
 "i did not think caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london
 the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met
" from herself to jane from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr darcy's explanation  there, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again
  you wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if i speak ill of any body
 the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers
 wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all
 chapter xviii
 it was the last of the regiment's stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace
 with such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr wickham and the officers, Mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin
 i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's connections
 "i wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer
" "i will not trust myself on the subject," replied wickham, " i can hardly be just to him
 when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him
 it needed all jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity
 she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion
 no, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very good luck, i may meet with another Mr collins in time
 she examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs collins's joints of meat were too large for her family
" "my dear," replied her husband, "i have two small favours to request
 his being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do
" "had you then persuaded yourself that i should?" "indeed i had

 whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure
 but i confess they would have no charms for  me
" she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted
 she was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so
 "did it," said he, "did it  soon make you think better of me? did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?" she explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed
 in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better
" "there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men
 "from what we have seen of him," continued Mrs gardiner, "i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor wickham
 well, he certainly is very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him
 miss darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful
 but georgiana would not join her

 and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment
 one morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to elizabeth, "lizzy, i never gave  you an account of my wedding, i believe
 Number
 to know that her daughter would be married was enough
 whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr darcy approaching them, and at no great distance
 elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her
" "an excellent consolation in its way," said elizabeth, "but it will not do for  us
 both sisters were uncomfortable enough
 after lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses
 but they did pass away, and Mr and Mrs gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at longbourn
 my poor father! how he must have felt it!" "i never saw any one so shocked
 make haste, make haste
 after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?" "and we mean to treat you all," added lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there
 elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her
 that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain, but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears
 if he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him
 miss bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening  she was his settled choice
" "yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight
" words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences
 she coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth
 good girl! it would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of miss bingley's pretended regard

 it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too, and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it
 the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion
" away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech
 and what do you think she said besides? 'ah! Mrs bennet, we shall have her at netherfield at last
 observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with, "i hope Mr bingley will like it lizzy
 he answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily
 i know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched up business, at the expence of your father and uncles
 he comes down on thursday at the latest, very likely on wednesday
 though lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr and Mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected
 but that is not the case  here
 miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much
 let  our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers
 but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house
" "what should not you mind?" "i should not mind any thing at all
 sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves
 "and they are really to be married!" cried elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves
 i would go and see her, if i could have the carriage
" she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held
 Mr darcy said very little, and Mr hurst nothing at all
 as they went down stairs together, charlotte said, "i shall depend on hearing from you very often, eliza
 jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare
" "i am no longer surprised at your knowing  only six accomplished women
 sir william did not say much
 of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with
 "my father and maria are to come to me in march," added charlotte, "and i hope you will consent to be of the party
 without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment
 her ladyship was highly incensed
 and on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper, "the men shan't come and part us, i am determined
 he began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others
 it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life
 he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him, to lay his private actions open to the world
 Mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off
 it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling
" "is that his design in settling here?" "design! nonsense, how can you talk so! but it is very likely that he  may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes
 bingley was ready, georgiana was eager, and darcy determined, to be pleased
 i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish

 as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters

 he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard
 a report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago
 after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday
 they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of  that they would have been glad to be certain
 unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only  child) i was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to  wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own
 neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane
 "oh! yes i understand you perfectly
 in this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence
 that she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs hurst and miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it
" "we will be down as soon as we can," said jane; "but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago
 i ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr collins's character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state
 "when is your next ball to be, lizzy?" "to morrow fortnight
" "yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside
 everything wore a happier aspect
 by tea time however the dose had been enough, and Mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies
 to kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected
 elizabeth, on her side, had much to do
 james's had made him courteous
 "do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain
 it was an encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should very strenuously have opposed it
 he knows of my being in town, i am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy
Number
 such was miss lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon
 elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot
 chapter vii
 elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london
 there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us
 "it would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference, but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of
 scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light
 he  was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey
" "my uncle is to send a servant for us
" "no, that i am sure i shall not; and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical
" the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane, who were dancing together
 come, kitty, i want you up stairs
 "why, my dear, you must know, Mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr morris immediately; that he is to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week
 elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man
 he had to be sure done much
" "she is a great fool for going away, if she liked him
 his brother inlaw, Mr hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year
 the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience
 as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go
 yet, indeed, i am in earnest
 till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for Mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her
 "it is a long time, Mr bingley, since you went away," said Mrs bennet
 i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude
 wretched, wretched, mistake!" darcy made no answer
 after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing miss bingley's voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family
 in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before
 eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley, and then hurried away to dress
" elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case
 at length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house

 to be sure, you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of  that when they fall in love
 she could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess
 they will have nothing else to do
 you must come and make lizzy marry Mr collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have  her
 his own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited
 well, he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now
 i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression
 his surprise was great
 but now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground
 at first there seemed danger of lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular
 he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity
 "you may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire, my dear cousin
 "it has been a very agreeable day," said miss bennet to elizabeth
" "your coming to longbourn, to see me and my family," said elizabeth, coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence

 march was to take elizabeth to hunsford
 their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first
" elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing
 Mr bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters
 it was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it
 he sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits
 the party did not supply much conversation
 you must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last
 he assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening
 he came to tell Mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both, wickham repeatedly, lydia once
 lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr bennet was likely to live; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st
 but she had no reason to fear Mr and Mrs gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication
 "pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried colonel fitzwilliam
 we seem to have been designed for each other
 she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence; Mr darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found
 she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton scheme, of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents

 Mr gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase

" "but i was embarrassed
 jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again, elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys
 "you look pale
 lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to  talk of giving them a hint to be gone
 it was an animating subject, and Mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match
 she had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows
 i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one

" elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence
 but whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation
" before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer

" "you appear to me, Mr darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection
" "they have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters
 "you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday
" "you did! and it was not wholly without foundation
-"i wish i could call her amiable

 but  now we may be silent
 Mrs philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she  did speak, she must be vulgar
 i am sick of them all
 this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but Mrs bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily, "you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough
 i will read it to  you "when my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to london, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel
 he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted
 in her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin
  their situation was awkward enough; but  her' s she thought was still worse
 after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london, Mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself
 with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at netherfield
 miss darcy's praise occupied the chief of it
" "would you believe it, lizzy, that when he went to town last november, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of  my being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!" "he made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty
 between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character
 but Mrs bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which would exactly finish jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before
 jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart
 lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter
 the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country

" "good heavens!" cried elizabeth; "but how could  that be? how could his will be disregarded? why did not you seek legal redress?" "there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law
 it has been most unconsciously done, however, and i hope will be of short duration

 when first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention
 on this subject, what can you have to say? in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?" "you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour

" the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner

" "oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr bingley's chaise to go to meryton; and the hursts have no horses to theirs
 in anticipating the happiness of bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house
" "you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our original plan
" he then went away, and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself

" "i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind
 she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very  unexpected"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow; and indeed, before we left bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country

 my temper i dare not vouch for
 no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting
 he called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on by himself
 in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr darcy, who sat opposite to them

 through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance
 Mr and Mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy
 good bye
 "yet why did he come?" she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak
 he was received by Mrs bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend
 elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight
 i told you in the library, you know, that i should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word
 Mrs gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her
" the wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual
 in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her own judgment of her situation
 it is too long ago
 by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself
 but, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy, who had been set up as a rival of jane
 she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas

 but i pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it
 young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but i think i may defy even  your sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer
 "can it be possible that he will marry her?" "wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her sister
 absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr collins
 this son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for
 let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has treated Mr darcy in a most infamous manner
 how Mr darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell
" "no, indeed, i did not
 bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on
 i feel as if i had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve
 not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body

 when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room
 there was one part especially, the opening of it, which i should dread your having the power of reading again
 in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room
 it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before
 she was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung
 it was owing to him, to his reserve, and want of proper consideration, that wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was
 her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day
 such i was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such i might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth! what do i not owe you! you taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous
 regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure, but i wrote to Mr wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs younge was of course removed from her charge
 there was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible, that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected
 the reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as i have given above
 Mr what's his name
 not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said, "jane, i congratulate you
 she dared not relate the other half of Mr darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend
 she could think of nothing else, and yet whether bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded
" elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression
 if she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough
 "you doubt me," cried jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason
 they both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered
 i am quite well
 it is Mr wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army

 this information, however, startled Mrs bennet; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so
 but i know the foundation is unjust
 to be sure london was rather thin, but however the little theatre was open
 when breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane

 i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to
 but if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself

 she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but jane; and even feared that with the others it was a  dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away

 i expected you to stay two months
 she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did
 they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family
 darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently consented
" "yes, madam," said Mrs bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine

 she was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him
 lydia's being settled in the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites

 i wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind
 but at length, by elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city

 she then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said, "by the bye, charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield? i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure

 after discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight; for lady catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men

 had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure
 the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn, and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement
 jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening

 Mr hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep
 "what could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning" and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him? "not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it
" after walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant, there chanced to be a little alteration
 the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter
 we have not met since the Numberth of november, when we were all dancing together at netherfield
  i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me
 "i have no reason, i assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception
 one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad
 there was certainly at this moment, in elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance
" "and what is fifty miles of good road? little more than half a day's journey
 i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family
 the moment of her release from him was ecstacy
 it was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever
 the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again
  we were always good friends; and now we are better
 she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise
" to complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia
" "i assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice
" * * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and Mrs bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived
" "if your master would marry, you might see more of him
 you dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind
 he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good natured, gossiping lucases
 "it may perhaps be pleasant," replied charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded
 she had very little notice from any but him

 how humiliating is this discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! had i been in love, i could not have been more wretchedly blind
" chapter xiii
 her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined
 "your examination of Mr darcy is over, i presume," said miss bingley;-"and pray what is the result?" "i am perfectly convinced by it that Mr darcy has no defect
 Mr collins then returned to elizabeth
 how long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am i to wish you joy?" "that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask
 be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove

 "of music! then pray speak aloud
 four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him
 my sister, i am sure, will not hear of her removal
" "will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again? at present i have not room to do them justice
 Mrs bennet said only, "nonsense, nonsense!" "what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he
 the day of his and lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth
 when the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist
 my sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, colonel fitzwilliam, and myself
" "and what am i to do on the occasion? it seems an hopeless business
 a most delightful place! excellent parsonage house! it would have suited me in every respect
 nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight
 he does not want abilities
 the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him
 he sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room
" "caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter
 you have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer
 the subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away
 we shall be at newcastle all the winter, and i dare say there will be some balls, and i will take care to get good partners for them all
 it is enough to know they are discovered, i have seen them  both" "then it is, as i always hoped," cried jane; "they are married!" elizabeth read on; "i have seen them both
 he now wished it more than ever
" "i have not a doubt of Mr bingley's sincerity," said elizabeth warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only
 every savage can dance
 it is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor
 she dared not even mention that gentleman
 jane was so admired, nothing could be like it
 the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête àtête with Mrs bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very jane he had fixed on
 of neither darcy nor wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd
 when this was done, she had a less active part to play
" "do let us have a little music," cried miss bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share
 smiles decked the face of Mrs bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy
" mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how
 twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh's foot stool, that she said, 'Mr collins, you must marry
 her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home
 we acted with the best intentions
 they walked on, without knowing in what direction
 there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds
 one must speak a little, you know
 my mind was more agreeably engaged
" Mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character
" "undoubtedly
 and to be kept back on  such a motive! i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind
 i could hardly keep my countenance
 she has two nieces of her own
 Mr bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene
 "how nicely we are crammed in!" cried lydia
 mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them

 they attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas
 nothing could be more delightful! to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr bingley's heart were entertained
  she blushed, and jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour
" "i suspected as much," replied elizabeth
 they owed the restoration of lydia, her character, every thing to him
 you cannot refuse to dance, i am sure, when so much beauty is before you
 indeed he has no improper pride
" elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop, or lady catherine de bourgh, by venturing to dance
" "good god! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "i will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr and Mrs gardiner
 "believe me, my dear miss elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections
" but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered, "no, no; stay where you are
" "oh!" cried miss bingley, "charles writes in the most careless way imaginable
" "well," cried elizabeth, "have it as you choose
 my child, let me not have the grief of seeing  you unable to respect your partner in life
" "but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure
 "there  is something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming
 an union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family
 it was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her
 you know i have
 Mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets
 he carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by sir william, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear
 on the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? the general prejudice against Mr darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light
" "i beg your pardon," replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer
" "do you really think so?" cried elizabeth, brightening up for a moment
 all loveliness and goodness as she is! her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating
" this was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for
 i dare say Mr bingley will be very glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy
" Mr bennet's expectations were fully answered
" "but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out
" a short pause followed this speech, and Mrs hurst began again
 mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached
 if you should have no objection to receive me into your house, i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, monday, november Numberth, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se'night following, which i can do without any inconvenience, as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day
e
 her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too  little, she might have fancied too  much
" "has your governess left you?" "we never had any governess
 when the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time
 "well, lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the collinses live very comfortable, do they? well, well, i only hope it will last
" "very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say
 i now give it to  you, if you are resolved on having him
 i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his regimentals
" "very true, indeed; and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? do clear  them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody
 the family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them
 i had not been long in hertfordshire, before i saw, in common with others, that bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other young woman in the country
 at that ball, while i had the honour of dancing with you, i was first made acquainted, by sir william lucas's accidental information, that bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage
" "certainly not; at first
 but in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded
" elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry
 they were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs bennet's civilities
 she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance
 i hope there was
" Mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer
" "if i were as rich as Mr darcy," cried a young lucas who came with his sisters, "i should not care how proud i was
" every body was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away
 the officer was the very Mr denny, concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed
" and taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to sir william, "indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing
" elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to colonel fitzwilliam, "your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word i say
 day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood
" "these are heavy misfortunes," replied elizabeth
" "dear madam," cried Mrs hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr gardiner? he has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter
" jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall; elizabeth was glad of it; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante
 chapter xvii
 i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible
 how thankful am i, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves
 i must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married
 it was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground
 i am not equal to it
  i only want to think  you perfect, and you set yourself against it
 i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so
 you shall hear what she says
 bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept
 elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself
 she was very equal therefore to address Mr bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it
 her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family
 but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else
 a house in town! every thing that is charming! three daughters married! ten thousand a year! oh, lord! what will become of me
 miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr darcy looked up
 chapter xiii
 she will be taken good care of
 i am most seriously displeased
 astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her
 i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit
 but we are all liable to error
" occupied in observing Mr bingley's attentions to her sister, elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend
 i roused, and interested you, because i was so unlike  them
 the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone
 she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference
" vol
 but Mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice
 Number
 but, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if i still assert, that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion
" "you have a very small park here," returned lady catherine after a short silence
 i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat
 to elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed
" "removed!" cried bingley
" "that would be a good scheme," said elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home
" the tumult of elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation
 at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her
 the feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten
 the coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to longbourn
" "yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had
 before any answer could arrive from Mr collins, or any congratulations to elizabeth, from his wife, the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge
 they went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her
 darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure
 i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it
 but you do not know  all
 "and that," said Mrs reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master and very like him

 teaze him laugh at him
 their fortune on both sides is splendid
 her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to darcy, much more than to any other person in the room
 the more i see of the world, the more am i dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense
 her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business
 had the late Mr darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated him i believe very early in life
 elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view

 Mr collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair
 "but how did he account for it?" "it must have been his sister's doing
 my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly, to try to discover her
" "which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a moment at elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, "she is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt  me; and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men
" "i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more
 my reasons for believing it are briefly these: it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable
 she was overpowered by shame and vexation
" this was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage
" "dining out," said Mrs bennet, "that is very unlucky
 elizabeth was delighted
 her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved
 "what is Mr darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him? i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing  he may not like to hear
 Mrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr bennet, and prepared for backgammon

" he listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long
" "obstinate, headstrong girl! i am ashamed of you! is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? is nothing due to me on that score? "let us sit down
 but Mrs bennet, was not so well pleased with it
 indeed, Mr darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear
 you both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage
 at length darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, "Mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his  making friends whether he may be equally capable of  retaining them, is less certain
 the observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected

 did you see it?" bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations
 in seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh! how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a like manner
 he was then, he said, on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her
 his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy
 miss bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt
 his behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured
" "i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want
 the least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person

 "indeed, you are mistaken, madam

 it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour
 the strangeness of Mr collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted
 chapter xvi
 but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr darcy's pleasure in the bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr denny, to whom lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, "i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here
 they battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved

 nay, were your friend lady catherine to know me, i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation
 but if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for wickham, and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment
 oh!  that abominable Mr darcy! my father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and i should be miserable to forfeit it
 it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom

 and her neighbours at lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady catherine) had only set  that down, as almost certain and immediate, which  she had looked forward to as possible, at some future time

" her aunt assured her that she was; and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented
 that such a consequence as  this should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts
 "but what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?" "a thorough, determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy

 colonel fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out
 how much you must have gone through!" her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr and Mrs gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party
 convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be renewed

 she had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr darcy, she moved again towards the gate
 may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?" "they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible

 it was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that  his being the intimate friend of bingley, and  her being the sister of jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea
 they have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better
 she was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self importance, and brought Mr wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented
 after this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropt
 but, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise
" not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs bennet give up the point
 the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family
 Mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity

 it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned
" "and you saw him frequently?" "yes, almost every day
 as that was the case, neither jane, to whom i related the whole, nor i, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? and even when it was settled that lydia should go with Mrs forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me
 Mrs bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income

 with respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr wickham, i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family

" persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected
 but Mr gardiner could not be seen, and Mr darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning

 Mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death, Mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to  him, as of affection to myself

 their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr and Mrs gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner at pemberley, before they left the country
 the advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely
 to no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to elizabeth; and from all bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own
 "eliza bennet," said miss bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, i dare say, it succeeds

 if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity

 he addressed himself directly to miss bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley's salutation
 she felt that jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility

 the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood
 lady catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr darcy
 i hardly know how Mr collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long

 wickham will never marry a woman without some money
 he cannot afford it
 and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, i am not able to judge; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce
 but as to your other objection, i am afraid it will hardly hold good
 lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that  he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter
" "but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?" "it does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt

 mary and kitty, thank heaven! are quite well
" "but you how are you?" cried elizabeth
 "you look pale
 how much you must have gone through!" her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr and Mrs gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party
 jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears
 when they were all in the drawing room, the questions which elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give
 the sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage
 Mrs bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing
 "if i had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to brighton, with all my family,  this would not have happened; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her
 why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight? i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after
 i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but i was over ruled, as i always am
 poor dear child! and now here's Mr bennet gone away, and i know he will fight wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? the collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what we shall do
" they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in london the very next day, and would assist Mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia
 "do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain
 it is not quite a week since they left brighton
 in a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost
 as soon as i get to town, i shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to gracechurch street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done
" "oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs bennet, "that is exactly what i could most wish for
 and now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already,  make them marry
 and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married
 and, above all things, keep Mr bennet from fighting
 tell him what a dreadful state i am in, that i am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that i can get no rest by night nor by day
 and tell my dear lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses
 oh, brother, how kind you are! i know you will contrive it all
" but Mr gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters
 though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that  one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject
 in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before
 one came from her books, and the other from her toilette
 the faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of kitty
 as for mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table, "this is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of
 but we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation
" then, perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex
" elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply
 mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them
 in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which jane was equally eager to satisfy
 after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, "but tell me all and every thing about it, which i have not already heard
 give me farther particulars
 what did colonel forster say? had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place? they must have seen them together for ever
" "colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm
 i am so grieved for him
 his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost
 he  was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey
" "and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry? did he know of their intending to go off? had colonel forster seen denny himself?" "yes; but when questioned by  him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it
 he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from  that, i am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before
" "and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?" "how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right
 my father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be
 kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step
 she had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks
" "but not before they went to brighton?" "no, i believe not
" "and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself? does he know his real character?" "i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did
 he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant
 and since this sad affair has taken place, it is said, that he left meryton greatly in debt; but i hope this may be false
" "oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!" "perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister
 "but to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable
 we acted with the best intentions
" "could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his wife?" "he brought it with him for us to see
" jane then took it from her pocket book, and gave it to elizabeth
 these were the contents: "my dear harriet, "you will laugh when you know where i am gone, and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning, as soon as i am missed
 i am going to gretna green, and if you cannot guess with who, i shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world i love, and he is an angel
 i should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off
 you need not send them word at longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when i write to them, and sign my name lydia wickham
 what a good joke it will be! i can hardly write for laughing
 pray make my excuses to pratt, for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to night
 tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure
 i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are packed up
 good bye
 give my love to colonel forster, i hope you will drink to our good journey
 "your affectionate friend, "lydia bennet
" "oh! thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!" cried elizabeth when she had finished it
 "what a letter is this, to be written at such a moment
 but at least it shews, that  she was serious in the object of her journey
 whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a  scheme of infamy
 my poor father! how he must have felt it!" "i never saw any one so shocked
 he could not speak a word for full ten minutes
 my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!" "oh! jane," cried elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?" "i do not know
 i hope there was
 but to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult
 my mother was in hysterics, and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done! but the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties
" "your attendance upon her, has been too much for you
 you do not look well
 oh! that i had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone
" "mary and kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, i am sure, but i did not think it right for either of them
 kitty is slight and delicate, and mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on
 my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me
 she was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady lucas has been very kind; she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us
" "she had better have stayed at home," cried elizabeth; "perhaps she  meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours
 assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable
 let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied
" she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter
 "he meant, i believe," replied jane, "to go to epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them
 his principal object must be, to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham
 it had come with a fare from london; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at clapham
 if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach
 i do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this
" chapter vi
 the whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him
 his family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion
 they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of  that they would have been glad to be certain
 Mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off
 when he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr bennet to return to longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel
 Mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces
 she shared in their attendance on Mrs bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom
 their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them
 all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light
