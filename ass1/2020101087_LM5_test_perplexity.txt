 the possibility of meeting Mr darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred. 11.489070083973624
 their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them. 6.985792972614253
 the two youngest of the family, catherine and lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. 56.436530083128375

 they had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town, where the family did not visit. 10.960422965255045

 with no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. 36.732745507377714

 while thus engaged, elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came. 13.751698507987218

 the apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. 21.26941464795156

 colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body. 34.67652319301096

 Mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. 46.5879989745695
 he begged pardon for having displeased her. 15.813291968376056
 elizabeth silently attended her. 8.358625672604537

" charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room, where Mrs bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on miss lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family. 19.922685217674516
 as they walked home, elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister. 24.969112453883195
 my mother was in hysterics, and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done! but the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties. 8.654939487452822
 if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me. 13.896326612723406
" elizabeth could bear it no longer. 1.4784744134970287
" she highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her. 22.719171400686626
 Mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day. 14.792934140463338
" "you make me laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound. 3.3426331947427883
" Mr wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr collins for a few moments, he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh. 15.02195308160249
 by many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain; mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. 22.28756104939808
 elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. 4.145068075753371
 Mr and Mrs collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself  near her family under less than  half the present distance. 28.107713812439567
 Mrs bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. 16.847627712548988
" to catherine and lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. 10.09465550282346
" "oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr darcy appeared. 8.819812283457086
 every body said how well she looked; and Mr bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. 11.848722896970559
 Mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do. 13.200667088206655
" her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano forte was opened, and darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it. 10.628095718118995
 the gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, bingley, who wanted to be alone with jane, proposed their all walking out. 21.67462999577662
" "what do you mean?" "why, i must confess, that i love him better than i do bingley. 5.0451458153630755
 the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. 11.755104169953354
 "on the evening before my going to london," said he "i made a confession to him, which i believe i ought to have made long ago. 8.968076035852608
 he did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately. 28.000224245355625
" Mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain. 15.867218376058542
 you know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. 8.22024105668996
 wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is. 8.88571013700782
" he paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her, "my dear miss eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. 22.98312540957616
-"you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. 6.235317264280603
 this has been my motive, my fair cousin, and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. 4.709374653386062
" "Mr darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth,  we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. 7.365386939642515
 and there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. 6.896827621882525
" "i am far from attributing any part of Mr bingley's conduct to design," said elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. 18.812470331666567
 "now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly easy. 4.563943970784062
 elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when sir william lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family. 13.494483821621815
 "tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley's. 20.63166119373887
 i am going away myself. 2.0137307415489114
 she was at least free from the offence of Mr darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. 17.069908723024067
" "certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. 12.600958460357372
 to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had miss lydia bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house. 16.382839352389745
" on such encouragement to ask, elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away. 6.089935398526596
 what advantage can it be to you to offend Mr darcy? you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing. 17.810022432327642
 presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on. 10.065066586672689
 your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say to you. 5.20897075659505
 Mrs bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast. 15.482342933517014
 i shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. 7.59531561221906
 he is nothing to us, you know, and i am sure  i never want to see him again. 4.747230900154345
 did you see him while you were at lambton? i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had. 5.22106164755287
 i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! i remember, as soon as ever i saw him, when he first came into hertfordshire last year, i thought how likely it was that you should come together. 12.903101074632003
 as for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin elizabeth. 13.089627707434968
 they found Mr bennet still up. 9.262835101086923
 "it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane," said she. 3.1673590827642233
 elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings. 13.449294765609503
 if i have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, i have not yet learnt to condemn them. 21.056122402869892
 this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. 5.1774888092343145
" "if! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?" "i never heard that it was. 10.350566448960546
 you know my sentiments. 1.1645181664367574
" "but not before they went to brighton?" "no, i believe not. 2.94047900743814
 at present i will say nothing about it. 1.9745330381544166
 your tempers are by no means unlike. 2.2726239200005156
 stop me whilst you can. 1.9339388677459746
 the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. 15.347695805051924
 the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. 11.146681574015757
 on saturday morning elizabeth and Mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary. 32.769583353749326
 but if  we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, i will take it on myself. 27.85251625334447

" here they were interrupted by lady catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. 3.4434313374814804
 "she did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go. 3.334594705119814
 i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner. 9.99899967872906
 the principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia. 6.979112063190648
 "don't keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven's sake! have a little compassion on my nerves. 10.646952458782952
 after breakfast, the girls walked to meryton to inquire if Mr wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball. 15.249113442153687
" "a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe. 10.273417270242948

 elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home. 8.078203420133113
" "laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. 5.6093324951334
 however, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and i am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves. 11.297189753078554

 my excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant. 41.83134858236331
 the five weeks which she had now passed in kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. 11.199030238851243
 "and this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!" in a few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose. 29.540347649784046
 "are you not diverted?" "oh! yes. 3.177990238089875
 do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley. 4.653485890654295
 his character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr darcy's sister, as, by wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away. 31.49077256649869
" "how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year! letters of business too! how odious i should think them!" "it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours. 23.36591938644433

 what a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go. 3.651526632741674
" "pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? where does discretion end, and avarice begin? last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary. 29.06686078921469
 they soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr and Mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind. 10.052900248745216
 if  she does not object to it, why should  we?" " her not objecting, does not justify  him. 11.103778256024519

 i perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. 8.207872511744654
 from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. 2.538162710022721
 but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. 17.959188516139765
 if you'll believe me, i did not once put my foot out of doors, though i was there a fortnight. 8.017219699591843
 pray, how  violent  was Mr bingley's love?" "i never saw a more promising inclination. 7.08122156386722
 but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. 4.92136451919177
 the subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. 36.17712706708904
 my feelings will not be repressed. 1.4803055831914556
 they had frequently been staying with her in town. 2.7386855983537055
 Mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them. 12.006216364376737
 nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world. 21.13098993831152

 yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of. 33.04996924817615

" "i would not be so fastidious as you are," cried bingley, "for a kingdom! upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as i have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty. 14.136572124151831

 his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling. 10.645491295951212
 the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and miss lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained. 26.8484170883119

 every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time. 16.95729507983588
 in spite of her deeply rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. 31.218616696601117

 it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man. 11.138437070153746
" " that is a failing indeed!" cried elizabeth. 3.893740565462143
" as she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. 17.598039848668332
 to Mr bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. 19.73737419420488
 about the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. 24.20347279878668

 miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry miss darcy. 5.605993217303962
 not a syllable was uttered by either; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room. 15.435788633320477
 what will you think of my vanity? i believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses. 9.319320500188445

 upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. 34.09133947588263

 when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. 17.74823949552003
 Mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. 16.39488421986397

 of his former way of life, nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself. 8.533002364312997
 she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion. 41.52653235834074

 it was not known that wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. 12.589116497411805
 in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. 7.589534568418638
 "you used us abominably ill," answered Mrs hurst, "in running away without telling us that you were coming out. 17.06579034647498
" when she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections  there had material weight with Mr darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr bingley for his sister. 41.611855462636974
 as she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs bennet followed her, saying, "i am quite sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. 13.588992423743155

 since her being at lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy. 5.82978476977037

 about a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in london; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to ramsgate; and thither also went Mr wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. 60.41483543067014
" "no," said colonel fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me. 3.28786761657748

 as they drove to Mr gardiner's door, jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. 40.850691146501724

 but he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. 10.066574662121495
 the sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them, restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike. 38.31304536904763
 if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. 28.545585539656926
" then, perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex. 14.854834025353883
 we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word. 2.5495329544006817

" "i should never have considered the distance as one of the  advantages of the match," cried elizabeth. 3.470257420098808
 a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. 13.019695719735726
" she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley. 4.390235382452442
 and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, i am not able to judge; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. 17.871810298146276
" "much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball. 10.047507973823315

 fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance. 18.489182839450557

 as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them. 31.5531943097219
" elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry  her, had she been his relation. 16.672768699359636

 as he quitted the room, elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination. 10.767908968716753

 Mr wickham began to speak on more general topics, meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry. 59.48041753183473
 that Mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to london, before they procured lodgings. 25.989399808986985
" this part of his intelligence, though unheard by lydia, was caught by elizabeth, and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. 34.076921851421446
 miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him. 20.974971035626055
 i wonder when you  would have spoken, if i had not asked you! my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect. 10.242854694489644

 Mrs bennet and kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr collins began. 13.334929666657949
 that his two sisters and Mr darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable. 21.232600940817647
 both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. 10.889688059223758
 Mrs bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph. 8.424110645616159
" "lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home. 10.888593685079138

 her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. 10.984699576148811

 but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. 47.12108353468103
" he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away. 10.524767383322423

 Mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips. 12.767089839846848
 when Mr bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn. 12.578028197082203
 on opening the door, she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all. 34.70464302198967

 to Mr and Mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. 7.595693072194553
 at length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! when i have a house of my own, i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library. 33.395915650345856

 there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added, "when i said that he improved on acquaintance, i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood. 26.452179338216503
 Mr darcy, you cannot deny the fact. 1.9506978752979363
 after an affectionate parting between the friends, elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr and Mrs gardiner, though unknown. 36.719460758982976

 a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self importance and humility. 36.59501316063255

 they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street. 24.6867940516096
 colonel fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. 22.18878067783003
 she could not think of darcy's leaving kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him. 14.66685022127545

 Mrs bennet's best comfort was, that Mr bingley must be down again in the summer. 11.310611959791347
 bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. 17.15650847015735

 the hall, the dining room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. 21.74976731445861

 Mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well. 12.353295725437958
 she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. 8.671002301796781

 Mrs bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when Mr bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was. 26.75647110089207
 after sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to elizabeth, "i hope you are well, miss bennet. 4.673329507460946
 james's, sir william was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. 24.636805118454614
 she was engaged one day as she walked, in re perusing jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr darcy, she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her. 18.153525604474627

 no sooner did he appear, than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. 9.937831319546127
 "but i can assure you," she added, "that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting  his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. 14.355719004211407

 though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that  one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject. 11.848934193944071

" as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as jane. 37.02347834340493
" elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. 5.278684058067168
 he took the hint, and soon began with, "this seems a very comfortable house. 6.889976417315556
 elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes. 10.68318483838769

" elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. 22.479296101758695
" "but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?" "you must decide for yourself," said elizabeth, "and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you by all means to refuse him. 32.620980062691544
-"as to her  younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not  know of any prepossession; her  eldest daughter, she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged. 26.539974539974
 the faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of kitty. 11.55660951436523
 all this was acknowledged to Mrs gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:-"i am now convinced, my dear aunt, that i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion, i should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. 35.16646195951209

 Mr darcy replied with great intrepidity, "miss elizabeth bennet. 9.757679436732444
" "and which of the two do you call  my little recent piece of modesty?"

" "shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine, what is to befall her?" "i am more likely to want time than courage, elizabeth. 12.354457359643112

" "my dear sir," replied Mr collins, "i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence. 11.004656634793784
 she turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there. 27.455428461965386
 he did trace them easily to clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom. 5.550936457814069
 in the former were many good paintings; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible. 20.5081989416351

 happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. 12.459046366619729
 with what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs bingley and talked of Mrs darcy may be guessed. 7.877985521636798
 i wish i could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly. 34.561279462439295
 Mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do. 13.200667088206655
 he delighted in going to pemberley, especially when he was least expected. 2.3259588749417976
 Mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth. 2.6111508660479643
 so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to  his easy temper, or  her affectionate heart. 5.053162880128046
 the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire, and jane and elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other. 23.074641702111837

 in society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. 11.883855914053678
 she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia, and, removed from the influence of lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. 12.323672080975122
 from the farther disadvantage of lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going. 10.118934480306145
 mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs bennet's being quite unable to sit alone. 9.74020475504767
 mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance. 23.673914013926993
 as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. 4.092090370367309
 he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. 6.858932476130825
 the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. 10.712304637692629
 the letter was to this effect: "my dear lizzy, "i wish you joy. 1.964997670459731
 if you love Mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham, you must be very happy. 6.980895782046885
 it is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, i hope you will think of us. 4.515154334432992
 i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much, and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. 9.107062315143061
 any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr darcy about it, if you had rather not. 15.647592899166364
 "yours, &c. 1.0029526653011245
" as it happened that elizabeth had  much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind. 6.660585008291636
 such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them. 6.173835359592667
 it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. 15.349342388387399
 their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. 5.037500710909487
 they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. 3.3517766362665284
 his affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her. 10.214890643457505
 though darcy could never receive  him at pemberley, yet, for elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession. 5.465398846595631
 lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to  talk of giving them a hint to be gone. 8.310301408896951
 miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth. 11.208238367842924
 pemberley was now georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see. 4.008748019669673
 they were able to love each other, even as well as they intended. 4.643837281789739
 georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. 13.563891148051852
 he, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. 6.41928532471322
 her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. 2.6273024776160594
 by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself. 6.024856330281405
 lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. 10.798930515405273
 but at length, by elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city. 21.999392052371064
 with the gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. 3.2072738818220192
 darcy, as well as elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them. 13.732644409266257
