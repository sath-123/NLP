 elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command

 there is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much
 yet, indeed, i am in earnest
 but when the gentlemen entered, jane was no longer the first object
 "it may perhaps be pleasant," replied charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded
 the note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with
 her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous
 miss darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place
 Mrs collins will be very glad of your company, i am sure
" "compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means
 when the ladies removed after dinner, elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared
 i came to you without a doubt of my reception
" "yes, in conjunction with his friend

 every park has its beauty and its prospects; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh
 Mrs hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr darcy's eyes were fixed on her
 she then took a large house in edward street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings
 that  she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head
" "how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it! but i wonder how long you  would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself
 at that ball, while i had the honour of dancing with you, i was first made acquainted, by sir william lucas's accidental information, that bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage
 i do think Mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously
 no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted  there
 it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit
 with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at netherfield
 elizabeth immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected
 it is impossible that he should still love me
 "you quite mistook Mr darcy
 Mrs gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs bennet and Mrs philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces
 his own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited
 i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement
 she had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means
 his words seemed to imply it
 "does that young lady know Mr darcy?" elizabeth coloured, and  said"a little
 i hate such false friends
 but they did pass away, and Mr and Mrs gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at longbourn
" "i never thought Mr darcy so deficient in the  appearance of it as you used to do
 he wrote me a few lines on wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which i particularly begged him to do

 but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion
" this was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for
 jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved
 she had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible
 "how good it was in you, my dear Mr bennet! but i knew i should persuade you at last
 and what do you think she said besides? 'ah! Mrs bennet, we shall have her at netherfield at last

 jane was distressed
 Mr wickham began the subject himself
 a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible
 he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re establish a character

 astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her

 with a glance she saw, that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed
" as it happened that elizabeth had  much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind
" "oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs bennet, "that is exactly what i could most wish for
" "indeed," replied elizabeth, "i am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me
 it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week
 had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but  his perfect indifference, and  your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! much as i abominate writing, i would not give up Mr collins's correspondence for any consideration
 as it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents
 it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills
 her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious
" elizabeth looked surprised
 Mrs bennet's best comfort was, that Mr bingley must be down again in the summer
 i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished
 four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister

 lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, i could not rest till i knew the particulars
 "i dare say you will find him very agreeable
" miss bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room
 let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has treated Mr darcy in a most infamous manner
 they were of a respectable family in the north of england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade
" "i beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think

 "if i," said Mr collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman
 elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view
 she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions
 "she looks sickly and cross
" "but he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune
" elizabeth was forced to go
 she longed to see Mrs philips, the lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs wickham," by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married, to Mrs hill and the two housemaids
" not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs bennet give up the point
 elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion
 elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known sir william's too long
 they are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines
 she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter
  that is all to be forgot
 bingley was by no means deficient, but darcy was clever
 bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on
 it had better have happened to  you, lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner
 "upon my word," said Mrs gardiner, "i begin to be of your uncle's opinion
 a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth; but at last on Mrs bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could not help saying, "oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him

 but what is that to me? if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, i shall certainly not be kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh
 a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on
" "yes," replied wickham;-"his estate there is a noble one

 widely different was the effect of a second perusal
 the world has been deceived in that respect; and i am happy to say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune
" as she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth
 his sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london
 i roused, and interested you, because i was so unlike  them
" her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano forte was opened, and darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it

 "it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane," said she
" "is that his design in settling here?" "design! nonsense, how can you talk so! but it is very likely that he  may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes
 you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me
 i wonder what he can be doing there
 jane now came up
 at present i will not say more, but perhaps when we are better  acquainted" he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other
 this was agreed to, and Mrs philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards
 "your friend performs delightfully;" he continued after a pause, on seeing bingley join the group;-"and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr darcy
 at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here
 only let me assure you, my dear miss elizabeth, that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage
 he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr darcy had been staying there
 "but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle
  you cannot have been always at longbourn
 kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do
 the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas's last week; and even Mr darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least

 and pray, lizzy, what said lady catherine about this report? did she call to refuse her consent?" to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it
 the distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles
 he had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein
 it is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind
 miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr darcy's progress through  his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page
 elizabeth went away with her head full of him
 elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane, on their first arrival at lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere
 at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner
 you will not, i hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf
" "with all my heart; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it
" "well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? if he had not had a family of his own, i and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents
 while thus engaged, elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came
 Mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character
 miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps
  he was exactly what he had been, when i knew him in hertfordshire; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with  her behaviour while she staid with us, if i had not perceived, by jane's letter last wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what i now tell you, can give you no fresh pain

 one morning, about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn
 the whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention

 the whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him
 they solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister

 after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr darcy, drawing near elizabeth, said to  her "do not you feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?" she smiled, but made no answer

 she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home
 my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me
 we are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been  one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and i dare say it would succeed, if miss de bourgh were out of the way

 there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him
 she retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse
 he then said, "i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly
 happy shall i be, when his stay at netherfield is over!" "i wish i could say any thing to comfort you," replied elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power
 do not you, darcy?" "my style of writing is very different from yours
 such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined

 as for jane,  her anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to

 i shall see her in january
 here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell
 i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude
 what congratulations will then flow in! i appeal to Mr darcy: but let me not interrupt you, sir
 i have not been used to submit to any person's whims
 she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him
" "but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure
 i know it cannot be long
" "to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it? it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum
" "miss bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that i am not to be trifled with
 wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is
 but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed
 she felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained
 our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly
 you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its  being  created
" catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to london
 bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends
 Mrs gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder
 she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance
" elizabeth smiled
 Mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise
" "and do you really know all this?" cried Mrs gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive
" "oh! hang kitty! what has she to do with it? come be quick, be quick! where is your sash my dear?" but when her mother was gone, jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters
 i do not wish to avoid the walk
 he is, indeed
 Mr hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep
 you have delighted us long enough
 "haye park might do," said she, "if the gouldings would quit it, or the great house at stoke, if the drawing room were larger; but ashworth is too far off! i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for purvis lodge, the attics are dreadful
 i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park
 he was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party
 if i had ever learnt, i should have been a great proficient
 miss darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side
" "but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham
 lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that  he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter
" "if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is, i shall know what to think
 donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations
 how i long to see her! and to see dear wickham too! but the clothes, the wedding clothes! i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly
 elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it
" this part of his intelligence, though unheard by lydia, was caught by elizabeth, and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make
 if you love Mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham, you must be very happy
" he made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton
 observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with, "i hope Mr bingley will like it lizzy
 that reply will do for the present
" "so much the better
 elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled
 but there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good natured wishes for her well doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain
 she had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste
 she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power
 she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange
 we are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but i have no reason for avoiding  him but what i might proclaim to all the world; a sense of very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is
 never intended to go there, or to marry lydia at all, which was repeated to colonel f
" this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss bingley
 egerton, military library, whitehall
 this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself
 between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character
 "i must ask whether you were surprised?" said elizabeth
 and, above all things, keep Mr bennet from fighting
" "i can easily believe it
 it was really a very handsome thought
_  engraved for no
 the happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do
 elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly
 she stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent
 "i am going to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows
" "but you are not entitled to know  mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit
 "a gamester!" she cried
 "it must not be thought of
 you shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness
 "we have dined nine times at rosings, besides drinking tea there twice! how much i shall have to tell!" elizabeth privately added, "and how much i shall have to conceal
 he had never had the slightest suspicion
 amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life
 "i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself
 the evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and elizabeth
 "wickham so very bad! it is almost past belief
" it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened
 elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation
 Mrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr bennet, and prepared for backgammon
 the business was therefore soon settled
" "you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which i have never acknowledged
 lydia, my love, ring the bell
 the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of sir william, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first
 it was dated from rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:- "be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to you
 he merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention
 elizabeth immediately began playing again
 her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary
 his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear
 he could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump
  his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out, "what is that you are saying, fitzwilliam? what is it you are talking of? what are you telling miss bennet? let me hear what it is
" "have you any idea, lizzy, who this gentleman is? but now it comes out
  too  much, i am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for i ought not to have mentioned the subject? this will never do
" "aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself
-"whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment
 she turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there
" "beyond a doubt, they  do wish him to chuse miss darcy," replied jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing
 we can all  begin freely a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement
 if you mention my name at the bell, you will be attended to
 as soon as jane had read Mr gardiner's hope of lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance
 after discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight; for lady catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men
 elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect
 we now come to the point
 if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity
 i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! i remember, as soon as ever i saw him, when he first came into hertfordshire last year, i thought how likely it was that you should come together
 its completion depended on others
 "i did not know that you intended to walk," said miss bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard
 colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings
 Number
 "if he does not come to me,  then," said she, "i shall give him up for ever
" "i did not think you would; and that being the case, i cannot consider your situation with much compassion
 they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which i cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects
 you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night
 darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather  knew that she was happy, than  felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her
 sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before
 chapter iv
 jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever
 after lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses
 much as i respect them, i believe, i thought only of  you
 elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another
 he carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by sir william, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear
 with his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning
 elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together
 but, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, i am determined
 on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband
 it is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining
 "i want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr wickham
 but we are all liable to error
 every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time
" "oh! thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!" cried elizabeth when she had finished it
" lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence
 were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain
 it was in the times and the courier, i know; though it was not put in as it ought to be
 it is because he will not give himself the trouble
 it was an encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should very strenuously have opposed it
" "you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society; and indeed i am quite of your opinion
 lydia's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself
 "i have an excessive regard for jane bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and i wish with all my heart she were well settled
 "you have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! unfeeling, selfish girl! do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?" "lady catherine, i have nothing farther to say
" "you did! and it was not wholly without foundation
 the envelope itself was likewise full
" "insolent girl!" said elizabeth to herself
" "in what an amiable light does this place him!" thought elizabeth
 it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind
 if  she does not object to it, why should  we?" " her not objecting, does not justify  him

" "i should imagine not
" "that is very strange
 when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room
 he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her
 to the little town of lambton, the scene of Mrs gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of lambton, elizabeth found from her aunt, that pemberley was situated
" "and my mother how is she? how are you all?" "my mother is tolerably well, i trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken
 as soon as they entered, bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day?" "i advise Mr darcy, and lizzy, and kitty," said Mrs bennet, "to walk to oakham mount this morning
 the evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary
 "but," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here
" vol
 he repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence
 i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but i was over ruled, as i always am
 she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her
 but i will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks
 Mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast
 miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him
 in confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on
 a little time therefore
 i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner
 they attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas
 a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of their  three months' acquaintance they had been intimate  two
 yes, miss bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all
" "thank you," said lydia, "for if you did, i should certainly tell you all, and then wickham would be angry
" "if i have, i shall be the last person to confess it
 that he was not a good tempered man, had been her firmest opinion
 kitty is slight and delicate, and mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on
 if you'll believe me, i did not once put my foot out of doors, though i was there a fortnight
 it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy
 i should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off
 but i make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves
 but, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy, who had been set up as a rival of jane
" "it may do very well for the others," replied Mr bingley; "but i am sure it will be too much for kitty
 but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render Mr darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole
" her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation
 his attachment to rosings, certainly increases
 i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good
 in a few minutes, Mrs bennet half opened the door and called out, "lizzy, my dear, i want to speak with you
" "let me be rightly understood
 with the mention of derbyshire, there were many ideas connected
 he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks
 "my dear, dear lizzy, i would i do congratulate you but are you certain? forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?" "there can be no doubt of that
 good gracious! when i went away, i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again! though i thought it would be very good fun if i was
' allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer
" "now, kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife
 my feelings will not be repressed
 his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn
 but, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise
" "aye that is because you have the right disposition
 stop me whilst you can
 "but it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded
 Mrs philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she  did speak, she must be vulgar
" in this manner lady catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added, "i take no leave of you, miss bennet
" "undoubtedly," replied darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is meanness in  all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation
 Mrs reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father's life time
" "if he means to be but little at netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there
 i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long
 one must speak a little, you know
 lord! how i should like to be married before any of you; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls
 had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort
 unless a copyright notice is included
 elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself
 chapter xiv
 elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship
" "let me write for you," said jane, "if you dislike the trouble yourself
 "you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing
 it must be an amusing study
" she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held
 "well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "i have no more to say
e
" "it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he  should
 "i am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper i ever met with
" he then went away, and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself
" "no," said colonel fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me
" "i  did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly
 Number
 his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy
 if he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him
 how thankful am i, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves
 you refuse, then, to oblige me
 elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham's name
 "well, well, and so Mr bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs philips first brought her the news
-"a gentleman and a stranger! it is Mr bingley i am sure
 it is a nice long walk, and Mr darcy has never seen the view
 she will be down in a moment i dare say
 but it is so strange!" " yes that is what makes it amusing
" Mr darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter
" elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse woman, walking was her only alternative
 i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection

 and with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former  were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn
 to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever
 we passed each other several times
 compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements
" "perhaps," said darcy, "i should have judged better, had i sought an introduction, but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers
 elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room
 but do not imagine that he is always here so often
 colonel forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body
 i shall certainly try to get the better
" "and this," cried darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me! this is the estimation in which you hold me! i thank you for explaining it so fully
 at that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion
 i am sick of them all
" "i like her appearance," said elizabeth, struck with other ideas
 when the ladies returned to the drawing room, there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted
 elizabeth was now to see Mr wickham for the last time
 "oh, yes! he was to come there with wickham, you know
 how could i be so silly as to wish it! your idea of the ponies is delightful
 if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark
 the pause was to elizabeth's feelings dreadful
 reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections
 chapter xvi
 after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn
 it amazes me, i confess; for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction
 conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none
' but afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time
 it was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain
 it was generally evident whenever they met, that he  did admire her; and to  her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent
" "your humility, Mr bingley," said elizabeth, "must disarm reproof
" "dining out," said Mrs bennet, "that is very unlucky
" the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued, "you look conscious
" "i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression
 and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection
 when he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr bennet to return to longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel
" when lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short
 indeed, Mr darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear
" "how should you have liked making sermons?" "exceedingly well
 they will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to longbourn; and i understand from Mrs gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all, before she leaves the south

 there was also a postscript to this effect
 "i am astonished," said miss bingley, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books
 her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too  little, she might have fancied too  much
 "excuse my interference
 in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew  more affection than she feels
" "oh! then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you
 the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred
 and she was only sixteen last june
" on miss lucas's persevering, however, she added, "very well; if it must be so, it must
 have you never happened to see her there?" she was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet
 you must send john with the young ladies, Mrs collins
 whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr darcy approaching them, and at no great distance
" "it ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason
 make haste, make haste
 nobody can tell what i suffer! but it is always so
 at length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself
 "how strange this is! and for  this we are to be thankful
 but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede
 he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia's flight, on her own folly alone
 could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections? to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?" elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said, "you are mistaken, Mr darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner
 to be sure that  did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he  did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about Mr robinson
 these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay
 but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, i shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read
 "e

 at present i am not in love with Mr wickham; no, i certainly am not
 i am the happiest creature in the world
 it drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present
" he paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her, "my dear miss eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner
" "oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr darcy appeared
" "she will drop the acquaintance entirely
 i pity, though i cannot help blaming her
 and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless
 two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it
 "my love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said her aunt
 i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least
 not all that Mrs bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr bingley
" no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful

 the marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants
" "what did you say of me, that i did not deserve? for, though your accusations were ill founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof
 as to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring
 charles, when you build  your house, i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley
 the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way
 "my dearest lizzy will, i am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expence, when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me
 "it keeps him in good humour," said she, "and i am more obliged to you than i can express
 oh! lizzy, to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall i bear so much happiness!" she then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with kitty
 but Mrs bennet, was not so well pleased with it
 every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane
 to Mr bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again
 lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste
 she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it
" "Mr bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? you take delight in vexing me
 she says lizzy had better have taken Mr collins; but  i do not think there would have been any fun in it
 Mr collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete
 she was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper
 never, since reading jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her
 "you are too hasty, sir," she cried
 he must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on
 such very superior dancing is not often seen
 but when she read, and re read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate
 the gentlemen did approach; and when Mr wickham walked into the room, elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration
 i have not forgot, you see; and i assure you, i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement
" "i am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate
" * * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and Mrs bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived

 it will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance
 with no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand
" chapter xviii
 but now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in lydia's marriage
 i mend pens remarkably well
 the subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away
 "you are a good girl;" he replied, "and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled
" "yes, very indifferent indeed," said elizabeth, laughingly
 mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter
 "lizzy," said he, "i was going to look for you; come into my room
" "and this is your real opinion! this is your final resolve! very well
 i cannot think so very ill of wickham
 that she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs hurst and miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it
 chapter xiv
" "it is  not Mr bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life
 but i hope you will not mind it: it is all for jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then
 chapter viii
 it was a journey of only twenty four miles, and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon
 chapter vii
 but his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited
 my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them
 chapter xxii
" elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet
 but above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked
 she would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house
 and what sort of table do they keep? charlotte is an excellent manager, i dare say
 in short, my dear aunt, i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted, or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? all that i can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry
 lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her
" "oh! it is of no consequence
 i told Mrs collins so before you came
" to these high flown expressions, elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent Mr bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his
 my mind was more agreeably engaged
 but the fact is, that being, as i am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place which, however, as i have already said, may not be for several years
 he cannot know what Mr darcy is
 elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it

 they must all go to brighton
 "yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! i  will leave him to himself
" "i certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said darcy, "of conversing easily with those i have never seen before

 my temper would perhaps be called resentful

 Mr collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed
 you shall not defend her, though it is charlotte lucas
 with astonishment did elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself
 chapter vi
 but, on second thoughts, perhaps lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person
 are you much acquainted with Mr darcy?" "as much as i ever wish to be," cried elizabeth warmly,-"i have spent four days in the same house with him, and i think him very disagreeable
 his wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind
 "on the evening before my going to london," said he "i made a confession to him, which i believe i ought to have made long ago
 there is nothing he would not do for her
 jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out, "oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?" "yes, i have had a letter from him by express
f
 as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr collins's scruples of leaving Mr and Mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing room, that Mr wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house
 but, alas! the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question
" mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good
 it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner
" "not that i  shall though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out

 miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much
 she was ashamed to think how much
 i hope she will turn out well
 had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself
 but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?" elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning
" on reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to miss darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at pemberley
 he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty
 "this fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend
 besides, there was truth in his looks
" while she spoke, wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning
" it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now
 stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all
 poor dear child! and now here's Mr bennet gone away, and i know he will fight wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? the collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what we shall do

" "we will be down as soon as we can," said jane; "but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago

 it would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two
 wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison
 respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown
 the account of his connection with the pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words

 the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood

 is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief? a glass of wine; shall i get you one? you are very ill
 "do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently
 the day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres
 by tea time however the dose had been enough, and Mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies
 she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very  unexpected"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow; and indeed, before we left bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country

 but not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company
" elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance
 charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding, "i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility
 in a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost
 and do you really love him quite well enough? oh, lizzy! do any thing rather than marry without affection

 "well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy
 colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings; and Mrs collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much
 to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther
 their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party
 elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley

 the day of his and lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth
" "miss eliza bennet," said miss bingley, "despises cards
" "no, no, nonsense, lizzy
 very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family

 lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself
 but i think Mr darcy improves on acquaintance
 "i am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said lady catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal
 the pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men
 but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence
 jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window she looked, she saw Mr darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister
 were it known to the rest of my family, i should not have merely my own gratitude to express
 "my dear, dear lydia!" she cried: "this is delightful indeed! she will be married! i shall see her again! she will be married at sixteen! my good, kind brother! i knew how it would be i knew he would manage every thing
 he began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others
 but, lizzy! oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness
 the business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news
 "he must be an oddity, i think," said she
" he listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long

 "i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence
 Mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility
 chapter iii
 it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one
 her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil
 she had obtained private intelligence that Mr darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected
 such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said, "in such cases as this, it is, i believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned
" "miss elizabeth bennet!" repeated miss bingley
 "if i had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to brighton, with all my family,  this would not have happened; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her
 allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear miss eliza, (glancing at her sister and bingley,) shall take place
 they could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign
 when convinced on that article, miss bennet had nothing farther to wish
 her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to darcy, much more than to any other person in the room
 and poor Mr darcy! dear lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered
 she will make him a very proper wife
 their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this! let me never see either one or the other again!" yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover
 she was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self importance, and brought Mr wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented
 pray read on
 many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man
 i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so
 "oh! my dear Mr bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball
 you must not disappoint your father
 the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch
" and rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr collins thus addressed her, "when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character
 * * * * * "good gracious!" cried Mrs bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley! what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? i had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company
 as for mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table, "this is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of
 my father, however, is partial to Mr wickham
" and she rose as she spoke
 the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw
" elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in hertfordshire
 they crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it
 miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former
 it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said, "i saw you look at me to day, lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and i know i appeared distressed
 she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road
 if she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough
 brother inlaw of wickham! every kind of pride must revolt from the connection
" "she is a very fine looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well
 "that is all very proper and civil, i am sure," said Mrs bennet, "and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman
" "such as vanity and pride
" "what sort of a girl is miss darcy?" he shook his head
 perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones
" chapter v
 your mother insists upon your accepting it
 her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, "why is he so altered? from what can it proceed? it cannot be for  me, it cannot be for  my sake that his manners are thus softened
" she paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse
" "what should not you mind?" "i should not mind any thing at all
 i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me
 allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr darcy
 elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "i have never had a cross word from him in my life, and i have known him ever since he was four years old
" they were interrupted by miss bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea
 at first there seemed danger of lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular
 their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first
" "i am sick of Mr bingley," cried his wife
 bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter
 there was one part especially, the opening of it, which i should dread your having the power of reading again
 she could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress
 but there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure
 she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word
 a lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment
 Mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention
" "kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill
 i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, lizzy?" elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible
 she had never perceived, while the regiment was in hertfordshire, that lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body
 but in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable
 you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one
 he seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within
 the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr darcy could not have
 i dare say Mr bingley will be very glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy
 i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be
" "well, then, you need not be under any alarm
 every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected
 they were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment
" and taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to sir william, "indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing
" miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections
 arguments are too much like disputes
 she felt that she had no business at pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it
 but really, ma'am, i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early
 iii
 we dine at rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home
 the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments
" "perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her
 by this time she is actually with them! if such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! what a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!" "we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said jane: "i hope and trust they will yet be happy
 but who could have foreseen such an attention as this? who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!" "i am the less surprised at what has happened," replied sir william, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire
 elizabeth could but just  affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it
 having said thus much, i feel no doubt of your secrecy
 "you write uncommonly fast
 &c
 bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful
 this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but Mrs bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily, "you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough
 you forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if i went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters
" and when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, "oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh, i think it will be very tolerable
 "and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr gardiner
" "upon my word i say no more  here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except netherfield
 elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made
 by all that i have ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary
 here, sarah, come to miss bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown

" "lizzy, when you first read that letter, i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now
 james's?" "never, sir
 we have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine
" "to oblige you, i would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him, i should only think worse of her understanding, than i now do of her heart
 i thought i should have died
 elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since  her coming away
 i would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day
 "i have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak
 with respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr wickham, i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family
 "it was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as his marriage was fixed on
 yet he knew to the contrary himself
 "you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, i should be completely in your way; and if the second, i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire
 miss bingley was engrossed by Mr darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her
 "who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?" "his misfortunes!" repeated darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed
e
" "very true; and if i had my will, we should
 her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth, as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable
 not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the pemberley house, is a powerful motive
" charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth
 elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london
 though lydia's short letter to Mrs f
 she tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done
 but does not jane correspond with the sister?  she will not be able to help calling
 Mr darcy was punctual in his return, and as lydia informed you, attended the wedding
 but you know married women have never much time for writing
 my dear hill, have you heard the good news? miss lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding
 let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied
 he placed himself by her
 those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable
 it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world
 my dear jane, i am in such a flutter, that i am sure i can't write; so i will dictate, and you write for me
 but i suppose you had no opportunity
 elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband
 the path just admitted three
 she had never heard of him before his entrance into the  shire militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance
 by supposing such an affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy
 jane was by no means better
 i knew it myself, as it was known to miss bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant of it
 you do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms
 they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene
 elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time
 till i can forget his father, i can never defy or expose  him
 you will be a very happy woman
" "the  present always occupies you in such scenes does it?" said he, with a look of doubt
" "i have already told her so once, by your desire
 after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london, Mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself
 we must trespass a little longer on your kindness
 at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner
 "sure he will not leave london before he has found them
 not these two or three years perhaps
 i have done with you from this very day
 "and may i ask?" said elizabeth, "but the terms, i suppose, must be complied with
 in three volumes
 his plan did not vary on seeing them
" lady catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied, "the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind
 the little gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome
 elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could
" elizabeth did not know what to make of it
 lady catherine observed, after dinner, that miss bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added, "but if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer
 how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell, but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you
 "now i am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself
" "no i cannot talk of books in a ball room; my head is always full of something else
 but every body is to judge for themselves, and the lucases are very good sort of girls, i assure you
) "well, so much the better
 the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of
 such was miss lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon
 his pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable, allowing something for fortune and figure
 if the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem
 Mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself
 "yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor
 the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! he had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce
 when Mrs bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before
 and, if i may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses
 you agree that the foundation, the trademark owner, and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual, direct, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage
 it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life
 Mr gardiner was a sensible, gentleman like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education
 i was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that  you, that miss elizabeth bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr darcy
 i am impatient to see him
 but before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her
" "i am exceedingly gratified," said bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper
 darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it
 the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball
 miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before
 till i was in kent, and saw so much both of Mr darcy and his relation, colonel fitzwilliam, i was ignorant of the truth myself
" "perhaps i do
" "oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr bingley's chaise to go to meryton; and the hursts have no horses to theirs
 her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness
 all was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation
 what could be the meaning of it? it was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know
 can i speak plainer? do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart
 "then," observed elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman
 in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr darcy were by no means over
 "come, darcy," said he, "i must have you dance
" "i know them a little
 as for elizabeth, her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards  one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out
 it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling
 every girl in, or near meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished  her by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites
 Mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me
 Mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus, "my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained
" "indeed, Mr collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary
" elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them
 you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite
 elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation
 but when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition
" "a little sea bathing would set me up for ever
 lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off
 but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both
" "her daughter, miss de bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates
 colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object
 his brother inlaw, Mr hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year
 you agree that you have no remedies for negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph Number
 when the clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so
 but however he did not
 he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all
 though suspicion was very far from miss bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here
 what could be more natural than his asking you again? he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room
" "certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world
" Mrs bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of  her, in spite of all miss bingley's witticisms on  fine  eyes
" "good heavens!" cried elizabeth; "but how could  that be? how could his will be disregarded? why did not you seek legal redress?" "there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law
 and tell my dear lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses
" "she is a very good kind of girl, i believe
 imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in  me
 the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place, that she might be farther from the door
 "you have insulted me, in every possible method
 Mrs gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how  she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but elizabeth had turned away her head
 there's for you! she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool; gone to stay
 absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr collins
 but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as i certainly did
 i shall be back by dinner
 elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend
 well, colonel fitzwilliam, what do i play next? my fingers wait your orders
" "i might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? was not this some excuse for incivility, if i  was uncivil? but i have other provocations
 they are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain
 i was never more annoyed! the insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people! what would i give to hear your strictures on them!" "your conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you
 they are gone down to newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, i do not know how long
" "if you believed it impossible to be true," said elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far
 believe her to be deceived by all means
 but now it was all too natural
 i should infinitely prefer a book
 in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger
 the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay
" "i must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied jane, "and i hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together
" "and so was i
 you know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, i confess, before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice

 i am confident that she would have performed delightfully
 she enquired after his sister, but could do no more
" "and what am i to do on the occasion? it seems an hopeless business
 when she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away, i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer
 she got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour
 the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks
 i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr darcy
 elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last kitty did, she very innocently said, "what is the matter mamma? what do you keep winking at me for? what am i to do?" "nothing child, nothing
 she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton scheme, of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents
 when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment
 all elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again
" "write to me very often, my dear
 you alluded to something else
 things are settled so oddly
 but i pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it

" "certainly," he replied, biting his lips
 they were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them
 many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; i wish i could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that i despair
 "he only told me, what i have now told you
" "upon my word, sir," cried elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration
 she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters
 but here he was set right by Mrs bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen
 as for your elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?" "it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied
 at our time of life, it is not so pleasant i can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing
 "do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? i cannot quite agree with you  there
" elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling
 if  i can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too
 Mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner

 the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation
 an airing would do me a great deal of good, i am sure
" he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go saying, as she quitted the room, "if any young men come for mary or kitty, send them in, for i am quite at leisure
 some people call him proud; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it

 any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn, i suppose, would appear far
 in a doleful voice Mrs bennet thus began the projected conversation
" "the person of whom i speak, is a gentleman and a stranger
 Mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at netherfield
" "you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr darcy
" "lizzy," said her father, "i have given him my consent
" "mama," cried lydia, "my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in clarke's library
 i was ready to die of laughter
" "it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first
 elizabeth was determined; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion
 i did not wink at you
 "and then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself
 with what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs bingley and talked of Mrs darcy may be guessed
 his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter
" the idea of Mr collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued: "my reasons for marrying are, first, that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish
 i think i have heard you say that you know them
 she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country
 it was lady catherine de bourgh
" mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how
 it was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it
 elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters

" this letter gave elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least
 her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy
 Mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton
 the feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten
 "i cannot see why Mrs forster should not ask  me as well as lydia," said she, "though i am  not her particular friend
" "but why all this secrecy? why any fear of detection? why must their marriage be private? oh! no, no, this is not likely
 it is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side

" "yes, madam," said Mrs bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine
 we were married, you know, at st
 perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice
 young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life
 elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere
" "to yield readily easilyto the  persuasion of a friend is no merit with you
 there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care

 they have some of the finest woods in the country
 he certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable
 he meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it
 Mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family; jane heard them with horror
 be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business
 i have certainly meant well through the whole affair
 her reflections were in general satisfactory
 you could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine
" "oh!" cried miss bingley, "charles writes in the most careless way imaginable
 kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step
" persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected
 i am always glad to get a young person well placed out
 they found Mr bennet still up
 they were not the only objects of Mr collins's admiration
 Mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope, that by the following christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office, another regiment should be quartered in meryton
 without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want
" "which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a moment at elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, "she is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt  me; and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men
 he cannot afford it
 he took the hint, and soon began with, "this seems a very comfortable house
" "in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of
" "there is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, i shall not be the person to discourage him

" elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "to treat in such a manner, the god son, the friend, the favourite of his father!" she could have added, "a young man too, like  you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable" but she contented herself with "and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest manner!" "we were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care
 elizabeth related to jane the next day, what had passed between Mr wickham and herself
 Mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker
 darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr and Mrs gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing
 could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts? she supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter
" "how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year! letters of business too! how odious i should think them!" "it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours
 their sister's wedding day arrived; and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself
 bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept
 as he quitted the room, elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination
 it was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day

 but still he would be her husband
 there is nothing else to be done
" "perhaps we might be deceived
 her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr bingley's name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion,  his mind was not very differently engaged
 came on into hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in barnet and hatfield, but without any success, no such people had been seen to pass through
 elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes
 "yet why did he come?" she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak
 she was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr darcy, she was directly retreating
" "perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh," said elizabeth
 let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest
" how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day! her aunt now called her to look at a picture
 his appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address
 he called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on by himself
" elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her
 family pride, and  filial pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this
 an union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family
 thank heaven! he has  some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves
 "nay," said elizabeth, "this is not fair
 "how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning, Mr darcy," she cried; "i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter
 she performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage
 i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but if the same circumstances were to happen again, i am sure i should be deceived again
 poor jane! i am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately
" elizabeth felt herself completely taken in
 with many compliments to them, and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter, to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed, "good lord! sir william, how can you tell such a story? do not you know that Mr collins wants to marry lizzy?" nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but sir william's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy
" "oh! i am not at all afraid of her dying
 they contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering
 she listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners
" "what think you of books?" said he, smiling
 she could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on

 he was then, he said, on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her
 he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me
 miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr darcy looked up
 "when i consider," she added, in a yet more agitated voice, "that  i might have prevented it!- i who knew what he was
 i have nothing to say against  him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, i should think you could not do better
 but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else
- you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly
 in the absence of jane, he always attached himself to elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of relief
 but of every other neglect i can believe him capable
 he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family
" "but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?" "you must decide for yourself," said elizabeth, "and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you by all means to refuse him
 miss bingley i am sure cannot
" "no," said her father, "wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds

 the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention
" elizabeth quietly answered "undoubtedly;" and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family
 "having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority

 his affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend
 "tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley's
 elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied
 those who do not complain are never pitied
 the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion
 it was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture
 and is  such a girl to be my nephew's sister? is  her husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother? heaven and earth! of what are you thinking? are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted?" "you can  now have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered
 she will follow wherever lydia leads
 when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door

" "thank you but i always mend my own
 it was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked

 and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment
 Mrs collins knew not what to make of him
" "you have a house in town, i conclude?" Mr darcy bowed
 now what have you to say?" "only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me
 "and  that i suppose is one of your sisters
" "will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again? at present i have not room to do them justice
 his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again

 i hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it i will carry my point
 "what, is he coming home, and without poor lydia!" she cried
 why should they try to influence him? they can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it
 more thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed
 on opening the door, she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all
 but such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited
" darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again
 Mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs philips, and  she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton
 i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen
" she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley
 but tell me, what did you come down to netherfield for? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?" "my real purpose was to see  you, and to judge, if i could, whether i might ever hope to make you love me
 not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said, "jane, i congratulate you
 every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr darcy, she could not but allow that Mr bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits
" "but does lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand?" "oh, yes! that, that is the worst of all
 i wish i could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly
 i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish

 he was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere
 their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the collinses' reach
 we acted with the best intentions
 "his father was an excellent man," said Mrs gardiner
 she asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name? elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly
 elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible
 lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to  talk of giving them a hint to be gone

 elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said, "you mean to frighten me, Mr darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? but i will not be alarmed though your sister  does play so well

 the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent
  my father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr philips, appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property
 "read it aloud," said their father, "for i hardly know myself what it is about
 pemberley was now georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see
 but she would not be secure
 he looked serious as usual; and she thought, more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at pemberley

 Mr collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair

 their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection
" however little Mr darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer
 in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room
" jane and elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay
 the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea
 it convinced her, that accident only could discover to Mr bingley her sister's being in town
 they had several children
" "a great deal of good management, depend upon it
 when i went away, i felt that it would soon happen
 "i will go to meryton," said she, "as soon as i am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister philips
 he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her
 they stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance
 if he  had  another motive, i am sure it would never disgrace him
 it was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr collins joining in, observed, "yes, miss elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church, and i need not say you will be delighted with her
 elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants
 she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting
" Mr darcy's letter to lady catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr bennet sent to Mr collins, in reply to his last

" "and do you impute it to either of those?" "yes; to the last

 i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished
 but what does he say of the living?" "he does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him  conditionally only
- that is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter
 of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough
 her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully
 but if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself
 by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself
 he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest
 she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct

 i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do

 on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book
" "i should never have considered the distance as one of the  advantages of the match," cried elizabeth
 as that was the case, neither jane, to whom i related the whole, nor i, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? and even when it was settled that lydia should go with Mrs forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me

 he had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you

 he added, that Mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave london, and promised to write again very soon
 had she found jane in any apparent danger, Mrs bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield
 they were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight
 elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation
" "well," said charlotte, "i wish jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to morrow, i should think she had as good a chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth
 but these are not jane's feelings; she is not acting by design

 she wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence
 she longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr bingley for his kindness to jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy
" "you have a very small park here," returned lady catherine after a short silence

" "i am not one and twenty
 "i did not think caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london
" "what is his name?" "bingley
" "i should not be surprised," said darcy, "if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers
 i think she will be pleased with the hermitage
 as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them
 she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who  did call on him in her return through london, and there relate her journey to longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which  she had refused to give
 the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again
 "and pray may i ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "is it in address that he improves? has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style? for i dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials
 elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little
 "i never heard any thing so abominable
" to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female
 we are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb
 their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency
" "that is not an unnatural surmise," said fitzwilliam, "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly
 miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her

 the gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice, "are you pleased with kent?" a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk
 as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females
 "'tis too much!" she added, "by far too much
 it was possible, however, that some of his companions in the  shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to
 i hope you have destroyed the letter
 she was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him
 "there is a gentleman with him, mamma," said kitty; "who can it be?" "some acquaintance or other, my dear, i suppose; i am sure i do not know
 that such a consequence as  this should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts
 but, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out
 it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife
 she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself
" Mr bennet made no answer
 as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go
" every body was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away
 their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets; and jane more especially, who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had  she been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure

 she was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr darcy and herself
 if i may so express it, he has a  right to be proud
 her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank
" and upon elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, "lizzy, i  insist upon your staying and hearing Mr collins
 they had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring
 i expected you to stay two months
 not lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power
 it was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return
 a man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing

 i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse
" "it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said bingley
 "my dear lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table
 i must find Mr gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; i have not an instant to lose
 elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when sir william lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family
 the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right
 i know no harm of her
 with  them he is remarkably agreeable
 Mrs bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again
 i dearly love a laugh
 i fancy, lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all
 this room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then
 Mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet

" "some time or other he  will be but it shall not be by  me

 she accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn, had by some accident been lost

 colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr darcy they had only seen at church
 colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body
 the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it

 if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once
 we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr wickham with money
" "indeed i do not dare
 his sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr darcy with a very expressive smile
 on applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was
" "there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men
" he then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister
 the rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of rosings
" and gravely glancing at Mr darcy, "there is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar  with'keep your breath to cool your porridge,' and i shall keep mine to swell my song
 it was not all settled before monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to longbourn

 the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street
 a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme
" "to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either
 the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers
 she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her
 the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by  him
" lydia declared herself satisfied
 let us hope for better things
 they saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve
 she was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, i am happy to add, that i owed the knowledge of it to herself

" elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs
 may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?" "they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible
" "may we take my uncle's letter to read to her?" "take whatever you like, and get away
 i am perfectly satisfied
 what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing's park, when he put his letter into her hand! she knew not what to think, nor how to account for it
" elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match
" chapter xiii
 i shall never forget her appearance this morning
" " Mr  darcy, you see, is the man! now, lizzy, i think i  have surprised you
 she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers
" "aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to
" miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour
 she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings, and had sent for him only the saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening
 "what does Mr darcy mean," said she to charlotte, "by listening to my conversation with colonel forster?" "that is a question which Mr darcy only can answer
 it is natural that obligation should be felt, and if i could  feel gratitude, i would now thank you
" "Mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife
" to catherine and lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting
" "but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied darcy

 "about a month," said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "he is a man of very large property in derbyshire, i understand
 Mr darcy had been at her sister's wedding
" "i should take him, even on  my slight acquaintance, to be an ill tempered man
 the moral will be perfectly fair
 but are you pleased, jane? shall you like to have such a brother?" "very, very much
 i shall now know how to act
 "i am sure there is not on  his
 to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her
 Mr bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him
 though i  know it must be a scandalous falsehood; though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, i instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that i might make my sentiments known to you
 he smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things
 thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart
 every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch
 will you come and see me?" "we shall often meet, i hope, in hertfordshire
 importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly
" elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts

 "and this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!" in a few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose
 she was overpowered by shame and vexation
 it was a fortnight since Mrs bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high
 Mr darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings
 they are my old friends
 every thing being settled between  them, Mr darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home
 but she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies
 she had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening
 elizabeth was disgusted, and even miss bennet was shocked
 her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley, "i can guess the subject of your reverie
" "all! what, all five out at once? very odd! and you only the second
 she has known him only a fortnight
 miss darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful
" "i see no occasion for that
 a scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation
 "good heaven! can it be really so! yet now i must believe you," cried jane
 but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice

 " you began the evening well, charlotte," said Mrs bennet with civil self command to miss lucas
 i will not spend  my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again
" elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion

 on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place
 she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself, some shelves in the closets up stairs
 but, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if i still assert, that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion

 i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that i had known it, and purposely kept it from him
" "certainly not; at first
 but i ought to beg his pardon, for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant
 the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl
" "ah!" cried Mrs bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls
" "but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another opportunity
 "she is so fond of Mrs forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away! and there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much
 he has children of his own, and may have more
 it was owing to him, to his reserve, and want of proper consideration, that wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was
 she was very wrong in singling me out as she did; i can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side
 at length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house
 on finding Mrs bennet, elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words, "may i hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth, when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?" before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs bennet instantly answered, "oh dear! yescertainly

 there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters

 "your affectionate friend, "lydia bennet
 "i cannot make him out
 lydia laughed, and said, "aye, that is just like your formality and discretion

 "indeed, jane, you ought to believe me
" "the letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so
 i always had a value for him
" then addressing her daughter, "oh! my dear, dear jane, i am so happy! i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night
 she was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung
 "i am perfectly ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball

 their powers of conversation were considerable
 the discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly
" "yes; he introduced us to his sister
 but their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle
" "oh, yes

 elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame
 Mr gardiner declared his willingness, and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation

 elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him
 elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes
 at length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready
 sir william staid only a week at hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with

 two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day
 there can be no occasion for your going so soon
 but in spite of all this fine talking, my dear lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for  another  interest in the affair

 sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king, during his mayoralty
 the envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages
 it distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage
 her hopes were answered; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard

 on their being joined by Mr bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery

 Mrs hurst thought the same, and added, "she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker
 at any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life

 and what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?" "she is a most charming young lady indeed

 and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications
 by you, i was properly humbled
 i have a high respect for your nerves

 Mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card
  their situation was awkward enough; but  her' s she thought was still worse
 i send no compliments to your mother
 the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed
 you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy
 and you saw the old housekeeper, i suppose? poor reynolds, she was always very fond of me
 a great deal more passed at the other table
 to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment
 they were hopeless of remedy
 his character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr darcy's sister, as, by wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away
 wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all
 but if  we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, i will take it on myself
 her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business
 Mr darcy was writing, and miss bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister
 secondly, that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness
 but  now we may be silent
 something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life

" "why did not you all learn? you ought all to have learned
 but, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference
 she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her

 when Mr bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure

 Mr bennet protested against any description of finery
 as they passed through the hall, lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on
 not one party, or scheme, or any thing
 "if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield," said Mrs bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, i shall have nothing to wish for
 not a syllable was uttered by either; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room
 he is perfectly amiable
 all field sports were over
 Mrs bennet could hardly contain herself
 he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia, to send any message to her
 i want to be told whether i ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham's character
" "i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party
 you supposed more than really existed
 easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the family at rosings, which in so small a circle must be important
" elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression
 but these, i suppose, are precisely what you are without
 i had not an idea of it
 in that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction
" "true," said Mr bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it
 why does she not come in?" "oh! charlotte says, she hardly ever does
 i desire you will stay where you are
 his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing
 on entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided
 he had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage
 from the entrance hall, of which Mr collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti chamber, to the room where lady catherine, her daughter, and Mrs jenkinson were sitting

 in the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off
 in lydia's imagination, a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness
" "this is the consequence you see, madam, of marrying a daughter," said elizabeth
 the commendation bestowed on him by Mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature
 we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured
 "aye, there she comes," continued Mrs bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at york, provided she can have her own way
" elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more
 it was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up
" "that is the most unforgiving speech," said elizabeth, "that i ever heard you utter
 Mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room
 she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than  she could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with  one, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side
 " you want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it
 by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration
 Mr darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together
 they found mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to
 and Mrs forster, and kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! when denny, and wickham, and pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least
" "pride," observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing i believe
" "indeed you are mistaken
 you are not well enough; you cannot go yourself
 she must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains
 i perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been
 i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner
 they entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent
 "i am by no means of opinion, i assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her
 in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour
 i will read it to  you "when my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to london, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel
 how wonderfully these sort of things occur! who would have thought of my meeting with perhapsa nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly! i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before
 there could not exist in the world  two men, over whom Mr darcy could have such boundless influence
 Mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips
" "what, none of you?" "not one

 Mr wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia
 Mr what's his name
 this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much
 it was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that  his being the intimate friend of bingley, and  her being the sister of jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea
 poor charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion
 she was  now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before
" "you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our original plan
" she found that she was to receive no other answer and, after a short pause, added, "i think i have understood that Mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again?" "i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future
 a low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing
 they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family
" "oh! do not repeat what i then said
 Number
 i do not know the particulars, but i know very well that Mr darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way
 lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention
 "while mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr bingley
 they then went away
 jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that  she would not give into it
 but really, and upon my honour, i will try to do what i think to be wisest; and now, i hope you are satisfied
 if he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, i shall soon cease to regret him at all
 since her father's death, her home has been london, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education
" "elizabeth, you are not serious now
 she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture
 but think no more of the letter
 as soon as i get to town, i shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to gracechurch street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done
 only think of  that my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time
 whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable
 kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for Mr collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton
 anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil
 i never heard any harm of her; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world
 first of all, he asked miss lucas
" the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and Mrs philips
 there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed
 elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth
 an express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from colonel forster, to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with wickham! imagine our surprise
 no arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind
 i quite detest the man
 elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings
" "i do not think we were speaking at all
 "my father and maria are to come to me in march," added charlotte, "and i hope you will consent to be of the party
 in future, i hope we shall be always of one mind
 how humiliating is this discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! had i been in love, i could not have been more wretchedly blind
 i need not explain myself farther; and though  we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable
 but with such a father and mother, and such low connections, i am afraid there is no chance of it
" "the country," said darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study
 she had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary
 "but it is," returned she; "for Mrs long has just been here, and she told me all about it
 it would be dreadful! she blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk
 she longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it
 no, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very good luck, i may meet with another Mr collins in time
 Mr darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours
 what a fine thing for our girls!" "how so? how can it affect them?" "my dear Mr bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them
 "and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but i am an idle fellow, and though i have not many, i have more than i ever look into
 i have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare
 as she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs bennet followed her, saying, "i am quite sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself
 it was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them
 she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference
 she declared her resolution
 he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard
 she followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down
 my objections to the marriage were not merely those, which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me
 "how despicably have i acted!" she cried
 Mr collins on his return highly gratified Mrs bennet by admiring Mrs philips's manners and politeness
 such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened maria lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at st
" my mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at easter, i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis de bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england
 bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed
 "books oh! no
 Mrs bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, "well, jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? well, jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love
 they had not been long together, before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room
" "shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine, what is to befall her?" "i am more likely to want time than courage, elizabeth
 the dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing
 and then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!" to this, mary very gravely replied, "far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures
 the foundation's ein or federal tax identification number is Number Number
" "oh! certainly," said elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions
 on the strength of darcy's regard bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion
 they had frequently been staying with her in town
" thursday was to be the wedding day, and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room

 a small sum could not do all this
" "he likes to have his own way very well," replied colonel fitzwilliam
 "indeed i have, sir," was her answer
 well, my comfort is, i am sure jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done
 Mr bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr darcy than he has received; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man
 and yet, upon my honour, i believed what i said of myself to be true, and i believe it at this moment
 from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents
 they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of  that they would have been glad to be certain
 to Mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough
" Mr darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh
 after pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read
 i assure you, that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it
 allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety
 when darcy returned to the saloon, miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister
 and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the north
 perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation
 it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of  some, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible
 she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make  her feel the obliged
 on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower
" "and which of the two do you call  my little recent piece of modesty?" "the indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting
 from their infancy, they have been intended for each other
 when Mr collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten
 it was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours
" "i mention it, because it is the living which i ought to have had
 i feel as if i had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve
 i will speak to her about it myself directly
 her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that  she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it
" "is this a hint to me, lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?" "no, indeed
 he enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done

 but there are two things that i want very much to know: one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how i am ever to pay him
 this is my advice
 on the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? the general prejudice against Mr darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light
 elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her

 Mrs bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph
 in this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away
 Mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard

 "they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! it would be such a delicious scheme, and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all
 a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern
 her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much
" Mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character
 she dared not relate the other half of Mr darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend
 one has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it
 the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice
 Mrs long said so too, for i asked her whether you did not
" his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to netherfield
 pride & prejudice
 Mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth
" "if you mean darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards
 he must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible

 she is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but i will  make her know it
 it was the last of the regiment's stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace
" "a man who had felt less, might
 my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better
 my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying Mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did
" as he spoke there was a sort of smile, which elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield, and she blushed as she answered, "i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family
 an hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to longbourn
 she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable
 i understand that Mr collins has made you an offer of marriage
 for the truth of every thing here related, i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam, who from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions
 "but i can assure you," she added, "that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting  his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing
 his revenge would have been complete indeed
" "an easy distance do you call it? it is nearly fifty miles
 it had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy
 nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world
 bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied
 give me farther particulars
 he stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to elizabeth again, he walked away
 but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to brighton
 as for the gentleman himself,  his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence
 in a short time, i shall have a daughter married
 darcy, as well as elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them
" "whatever my connections may be," said elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to  you
 in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day
 she had ventured only one glance at darcy
 it was as follows: "my dear sir, "i feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire
 "i hope, my dear," said Mr bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to day, because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party
 "you are quite a visit in my debt, Mr bingley," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned
 could she exert herself it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, i never in my life saw him so affected
 mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball
" "her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament
 my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking
 chapter xix
" elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself
 but nothing can be done; i know very well that nothing can be done
 to the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long
 Mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets
" "in point of composition," said mary, "his letter does not seem defective
 his accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother
 he then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else
 her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable; and could she have included jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect
 they were in - street

" their party in the dining room was large, for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her
 the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone
 i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning
 i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it
 the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister
 "i know not, miss elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it
 in Number, the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg tm and future generations
 "his being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment
 after a short silence, the lady first spoke
 Mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary
 she was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed
 you have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert
 oh! had i known what i ought, what i dared, to do! but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much
" Mr gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from colonel forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send
 when this was done, she had a less active part to play
" "la! you are so strange! but i must tell you how it went off
 it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy
" "i did not know before," continued bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character
 they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother
 pray, how  violent  was Mr bingley's love?" "i never saw a more promising inclination
 she was wild to be at home to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe
 he made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him
" but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered, "no, no; stay where you are
 "you may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire, my dear cousin
" "yes but as it happens, they are all of them very clever
 after tea, Mr bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and mary went up stairs to her instrument
 with a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations
 "how could i ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face
 his apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else
 "but surely," said she, "i may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me
 will you be very angry with me, my dear lizzy, if i take this opportunity of saying (what i was never bold enough to say before) how much i like him
 against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged jane to borrow Mr bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made
 chapter xi
" this was not very consoling to Mrs bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before, "i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate
 my avowed one, or what i avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which i have since made
 though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour
" in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone
 but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you
" "Mr darcy is all politeness," said elizabeth, smiling
" "well, all i know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him
 each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them
" then, after a short silence, he continued, "lizzy, i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind
 i cannot think of it without abhorrence
 presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on
 in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her own judgment of her situation
" Mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal from the  shire, as clearly as Mr gardiner could do
 my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, i shall certainly not depart from it
 the horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them
" no one made any reply
 "this will not do," said elizabeth
" elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved
 Mrs collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home
 Mrs bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual
 he looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man, asked her how she had liked him
a
 the children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them, playing with them, and loving them

 all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over
 i have suspected it some time, but i am now convinced
 if he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight
 it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; oxford, blenheim, warwick, kenelworth, birmingham, &c
 the two youngest of the family, catherine and lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt
 his surprise was great
 you will have a charming mother inlaw, indeed, and of course she will be always at pemberley with you
 she examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs collins's joints of meat were too large for her family
 i cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as i often see done
" "and i have another favour to ask
" " you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet
 lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so good humoured as lydia
" " that you certainly shall
 on both sides it was only assertion
 on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton, he dined with others of the officers at longbourn; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford, she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and Mr darcy's having both spent three weeks at rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former
" "i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied
" "my object  then," replied darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to
 my sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, colonel fitzwilliam, and myself
 the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished
 i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr denny comes back from town
" "let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility
 she knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour
 "i am, dear sir, &c
 i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow
 she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery
" "indeed, mama, you are mistaken," said elizabeth, blushing for her mother
 but now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground
 "not at all
" "oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with
 she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height, or rather taller

 nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant
 we have judged it best, that my niece should be married from this house, of which i hope you will approve
 his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling
 "you have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty
 "oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain
 a report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago
 "i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself
 Mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity
" elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure
 at length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs reynolds replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to morrow, with a large party of friends
 a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it
 his marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy
" "take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment
 the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again
 to convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point
 it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned

 she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her
 i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it
" "nothing is more deceitful," said darcy, "than the appearance of humility
" "so much the better
 "but it is fortunate," thought she, "that i have something to wish for
" "oh, well! it is just as he chooses
 it is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions
-"as to her  younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not  know of any prepossession; her  eldest daughter, she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged
 to know that her daughter would be married was enough
 with assumed tranquillity he then replied, "i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that i rejoice in my success
 his regiment is there; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the  shire, and of his being gone into the regulars
 to no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to elizabeth; and from all bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own
" "oh! shocking!" cried miss bingley
 do not imagine, miss bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified
 she was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her
 elizabeth, equally next to jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course
 he spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride
" "i shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own
" "i suspected as much," replied elizabeth
 i know it to be impossible
" "you may depend upon my not mentioning it
 but no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled
 Mr darcy walked off; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him

 it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast
 Mrs bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast
" "to be sure, lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as wickham; or rather he has not wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good
 how grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family! when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful
 my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room
 he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted

 they insist also on my seeing Mr jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and head ache there is not much the matter with me
 she felt that jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility
 the least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person
 but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising
 follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies  do divert me, i own, and i laugh at them whenever i can

 "i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places
 but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information
 steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her
 the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield, which was fixed for the following tuesday
 he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune
 but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt
" charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room, where Mrs bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on miss lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family
 have you seen any pleasant men? have you had any flirting? i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back
 "this was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own

 the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic
 wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish
 "indeed, Mr bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that i should be forced to make way for  her, and live to see her take my place in it!" "my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts
  that is all settled
 but we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride
 do let me ask my partner to introduce you
 she felt anew the justice of Mr darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend
 "yes if darcy does not put it off again
 lydia, my love, though you  are the youngest, i dare say Mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball
" "then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr bingley to  her

 but vanity, not love, has been my folly
 * * * * * in the evening, soon after Mr bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme
 they had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town, where the family did not visit
 [illustration: a vicarage house
" elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room
 amongst the most violent against him was Mrs bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters
 this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them
" "perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and Mr robinson; did not i mention it to you? Mr robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and  which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question oh! the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point
 in seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh! how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a like manner
 no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard
" "well, and what news does it bring? good or bad?" "what is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it
" Mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, " you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment
 their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp
 for though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body
 they battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved

" the picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed rooms, were all that remained to be shewn
 your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from Mr wickham
 the present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from  that, though elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of darcy, she could have borne the dread of lydia's infamy somewhat better
 there can be no love in all this
" "tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?" though elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation, "i am not

" Mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward
 she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room
 her look and manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and i remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment
 "how nicely we are crammed in!" cried lydia
 in anticipating the happiness of bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house
 in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to elizabeth, said, "miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room
 he meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere
 after abusing you so abominably to your face, i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations
" "was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane, while she was ill at netherfield?" "dearest jane! who could have done less for her? but make a virtue of it by all means
 i do not deserve it
 their fortune on both sides is splendid
 that she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection

 when all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish

 though her manner varied however, her determination never did
 "john told us Mr darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?" "yes; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement
" "that would be a good scheme," said elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home
 elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased
" bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business

 one ought not to repine; but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! the quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness! but it was not to be
 the visit was returned in due form
 nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy
 he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while
 this however was no evil to elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors
 the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment
 you both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage
 but when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding
 their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them
' are any of your younger sisters out, miss bennet?" "yes, ma'am, all
 "that is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to  me to have many such acquaintance
 no thanks to his gallantry for that
 many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if  he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia's connections, which is not likely, can i suppose her so lost to every thing? impossible
 at such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward
 the park was very large, and contained great variety of ground
 i was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him
 but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there
" "it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends
" elizabeth turned away to hide a smile
 i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her
" "you appear to me, Mr darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection
" "i say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him," replied the other
 "project gutenberg" is a registered trademark
 her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it
 elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last
 miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense
 accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer
 and  that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter
 you shall hear what she says
 the foundation's principal office is located at Number melan dr
 at such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband
" "she did indeed, louisa
 what is your own opinion?" "that it ought not to be attempted
 "i wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer
 Mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away
 you must come and make lizzy marry Mr collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have  her
 he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, lydia's expences had been very little within that sum
 "this is wholly unexpected
 but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art
 they went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her
 "very well and this offer of marriage you have refused?" "i have, sir
 and in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount
 "if one could but go to brighton!" observed Mrs bennet
 as they drove to Mr gardiner's door, jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever
 and her neighbours at lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady catherine) had only set  that down, as almost certain and immediate, which  she had looked forward to as possible, at some future time

 it will pass away soon enough
 Mr gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase
 his affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her
 "oh, jane, take care
 "dear sir, "i must trouble you once more for congratulations
 "Mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he? poor eliza! to be only just  tolerable

" but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation
" Mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments
 when the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time
 let me mend it for you
" "it will be  her turn soon to be teazed," said miss lucas
 while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible
 she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest, but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering; and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks
 i am so pleased so happy
 her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home
 but he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief
 she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance
 after walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park
 the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of lady catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough
 he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true
 the latter was thinking only of his breakfast
" "very true, indeed; and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? do clear  them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody
" "your coming to longbourn, to see me and my family," said elizabeth, coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence
" "is he married or single?" "oh! single, my dear, to be sure! a single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year
 in pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered meryton
" "all this she must possess," added darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading
 if it was not for the entail i should not mind it
 the officers of the  shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as  they were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room
" "in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure," said bingley; "and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well
 the next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand
 it was gratitude
 you need not send them word at longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when i write to them, and sign my name lydia wickham
 "i almost envy you the pleasure, and yet i believe it would be too much for me, or else i could take it in my way to newcastle
" "money! my uncle!" cried jane, "what do you mean, sir?" "i mean, that no man in his senses, would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after i am gone
 when you told Mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?" "nay," cried bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning
" it was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from jane
 "i see your design, bingley," said his friend
 "i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he, as he joined her
 elizabeth was delighted
 lady catherine then observed, "your father's estate is entailed on Mr collins, i think
" "you are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment
 "well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "what say you to the day? i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, i assure you
 of what he has  particularly accused me i am ignorant; but of the truth of what i shall relate, i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity
 she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion
 she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley
" "that is very true," replied elizabeth, "and i could easily forgive  his pride, if he had not mortified  mine
 when a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty
 elizabeth's courage did not fail her
 "it certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr bennet, "and nothing can clear Mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn
 they were natural and just
 elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance
 a clergyman like you must marry
 they could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit
 the particulars, i reserve till we meet
 it had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as miss darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning
" she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment
 elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for  her, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr bingley and netherfield
 she remembered also, that till the netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son
 you could scarcely escape discredit and misery
 Mr collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied, "it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably
 we have not met since the Numberth of november, when we were all dancing together at netherfield

 "if, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "i shall know how to understand it

" she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley
 miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth
 * * * * * Mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother
 when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him

" "his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said elizabeth angrily; "for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr darcy's steward, and of  that, i can assure you, he informed me himself
 the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained
" elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, jane and kitty followed, but lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear

 they walked on, without knowing in what direction
 he observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "it is above eight months
 as for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin elizabeth

 who is to fight wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?" as Mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to london, at the same time that Mr bennet came from it
 i cannot misunderstand you, but i intreat you, dear lizzy, not to pain me by thinking  that  person to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk

 you will be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him
 it was an animating subject, and Mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match
 no; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called
 this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part
 he drew a chair near her
 she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise
 he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all
 ii
 he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information
 Mr bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable
 you and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us

 i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister
 to this speech bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations
 Mr collins's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs bennet
 Mrs gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her
 chapter ix
 nay, were your friend lady catherine to know me, i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation
" * * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs bennet's curiosity; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject
 in revolving lady catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference
 if elizabeth, when Mr darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents
 Mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent
 i write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation, and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read
" Mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication
 "and then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over
 her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family
 "but to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable
 but there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, i had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me
 elizabeth, to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation
 "you begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her
 you know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it
 on the following monday, Mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn

 she respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses

 "i am afraid, Mr darcy," observed miss bingley, in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes
 i will have no reserves from  you
 Mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth, "i am glad you are come back, lizzy
 he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should  now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it
 do not distress me by the idea
" "would Mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?" "upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter, darcy must speak for himself
" miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject
 "next time you call," said she, "i hope we shall be more lucky
 when first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were
 can you, yourself, lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?" "not perhaps of neglecting his own interest
 she was very equal therefore to address Mr bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it
 Mr bingley was good looking and gentleman like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners
" "why will you think so? it must be his own doing
 you have employed your time much better
 Mr darcy replied with great intrepidity, "miss elizabeth bennet
 i do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and i am sure if i had been you, i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it
 hope was over, entirely over; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort

 his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit
 elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal
 to be sure london was rather thin, but however the little theatre was open

 they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves
" "were it certain that lady catherine would think so," said Mr collins very  gravely"but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you
" elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce
 they soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr and Mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind
 but no," recollecting herself,-"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: i should not have been allowed to invite them
 the discussion of Mr collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother
" "that is not very likely; our authority was too good
" "that is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare
 they owed the restoration of lydia, her character, every thing to him
" "do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?" "it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it
 but as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used
" "i beg your pardon," replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer
" "is this," thought elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "and pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger son? unless the elder brother is very sickly, i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds
 he is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women

 from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how  he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce
 the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend
 mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance
 Mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr collins by jane's introduction of him

 before any answer could arrive from Mr collins, or any congratulations to elizabeth, from his wife, the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge

 Mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year
 much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married
 she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable

" elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying
" "it  is wonderful," replied wickham,-"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend
 though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that  one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject
 the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune
 if  you have not been mistaken here,  i must have been in an error
 when they were gone, elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent
 she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct
 you are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage
 her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty
" "i am no longer surprised at your knowing  only six accomplished women
 i have not a doubt of your doing very well together
" sir william only smiled
 i have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude
 but at length, by elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city
" "the letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, i hope, quite so easily changed as that implies

 my faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! but perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design

 the younger girls formed hopes of  coming  out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's dying an old maid
 "what would she have said? how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself
 bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter
" here they were interrupted by lady catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of
" it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first
 "i do not blame jane," she continued, "for jane would have got Mr bingley, if she could
 the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family
 "it has been a very agreeable day," said miss bennet to elizabeth
" elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr wickham's attentions
 nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related
 she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr darcy
" "ah! sir, i do indeed
 wont it, kitty?" kitty owned that she had rather stay at home
" "we are not in a way to know  what Mr bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit
 charlotte the wife of Mr collins, was a most humiliating picture! and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen
 a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love
 and when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; Mr bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man
 "well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband? is not he a charming man? i am sure my sisters must all envy me
 elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them
" the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well
 after a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display
" "aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if i had known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one
 bingley and jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them
 how does georgiana get on, darcy?" Mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency
 you may remember what i told you on that point, when first we talked of it
 you have widely mistaken my character, if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these
 they lagged behind, while elizabeth, kitty, and darcy, were to entertain each other
 however, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were
 many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory

 their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush
 Mr wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a strong inducement
" Mrs gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation
 i am glad he dines here on tuesday
" Mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain
 the only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter
 when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible
 he begged pardon for having displeased her

" "i believe, ma'am, i may safely promise you  never to dance with him
 she would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable
 her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield, to longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire
 the sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage
 how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd! yet it did, and even a third
 my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology
 his most particular friend, you see by jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her
" "and i certainly  never shall give it
 he has given in all his debts; i hope at least he has not deceived us
 Mrs bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere
" "believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire
 elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's
 lady catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr darcy
 in the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron
 nor was darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery
 this cannot be! engaged to Mr darcy! no, no, you shall not deceive me
" elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend
 elizabeth had settled it that Mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning
 we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect
 such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them
 how is such a man to be worked on? how are they even to be discovered? i have not the smallest hope
 two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them
" "i never can be thankful, Mr bennet, for any thing about the entail
 he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father
 they were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of pemberley might be something! they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned
 she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage
 and, my dear jane, i never saw you look in greater beauty
 "and this is always the way with him," she added
 "my dear eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way
 your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i come
 wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable
 her answer was warmly in his favour
 he is not at all liked in hertfordshire
 of neither darcy nor wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd
 i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements
" "certainly," replied  elizabeth"there are such people, but i hope i am not one of  them
 colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon
 they could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for Mr darcy
 at length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said, "and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting! i might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little  endeavour at civility, i am thus rejected
 it is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it
 her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined

 i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere
 this is not quite enough to make her understand his character

 "i see what you are feeling," replied charlotte,-"you must be surprised, very much surprised, so lately as Mr collins was wishing to marry you
 it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way
" Mr gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister
 she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence; Mr darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found
" "can i have the carriage?" said jane

 but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes
 he heard her attentively, and then said, "lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances

 lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr collins, in describing the civility of Mr and Mrs philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house
 the ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse

 caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that i can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself
 Mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both
" "at four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace making gentleman," said Mr bennet, as he folded up the letter

 darcy said nothing at all
 but she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity
 when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both
 oh! how acutely did she now feel it
 she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater what shall i call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough
 the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but elizabeth, less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence
 when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small
 his sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion
 on this subject i have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer

 from his garden, Mr collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while sir william accompanied him, charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help
 lady catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance
 he had never before supposed that, could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present arrangement

 her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense
 kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs forster and me are  such friends!) and so she asked the two harringtons to come, but harriet was ill, and so pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? we dressed up chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! not a soul knew of it, but col

 elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom
 the five weeks which she had now passed in kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees
 her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is
 but Mr gardiner could not be seen, and Mr darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning
 lady catherine rose also, and they turned back
 after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, "but tell me all and every thing about it, which i have not already heard

 Mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday; on tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street

 charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen

 this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself
 with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my dearest jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?" "what think you of  this sentence, my dear lizzy?" said jane as she finished it
 if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one
 it is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess
 the loo table, however, did not appear
 "how could you begin?" said she
 it was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting  when she had seen him last in hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed, "how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november, Mr darcy! it must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, he went but the day before
 but i shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched
 your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage
 we seem to have been designed for each other
" "no, that i am sure i shall not; and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical
 your mother will never see you again if you do  not marry Mr collins, and i will never see you again if you  do
 my aunt told me so herself on saturday
 it was first broken by Mrs annesley, a genteel, agreeable looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs gardiner, with occasional help from elizabeth, the conversation was carried on
 the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected
 i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them
 i wish i could see her
 think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure
 jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr darcy could be so unworthy of Mr bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham
 could there be finer symptoms? is not general incivility the very essence of love?" "oh, yes! of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt
 Mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces
 recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, "sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of
" "yes, and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise
 not like the wild young men now adays, who think of nothing but themselves
 my brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart
" "and yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand them
 you know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself

 they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants
 end of the second volume
 her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little
 i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to
 gardiner
 the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn, and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement
" then shewing her purchases: "look here, i have bought this bonnet
 "my dear father, i congratulate you
" elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing
 Mrs gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends
 she could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man
 when the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to elizabeth, "do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel
 and on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper, "the men shan't come and part us, i am determined
 i should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire
 the express was sent off directly
 i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn
 i should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company
 let me advise you then, my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence
 Mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day
 my excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant
 but, lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or jane at most
 but my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr darcy is particularly fond of, that i may have it to morrow
 you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for  your approbation alone
" "certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger
 nor did that day wear out her resentment
 my dear, dear lydia! how merry we shall be together when we meet!" her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr gardiner's behaviour laid them all under
 after sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to elizabeth, "i hope you are well, miss bennet
 wickham's affection for lydia, was just what elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to lydia's for him
 i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance

 every body said how well she looked; and Mr bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice
 "i assure you there is quite as much of  that going on in the country as in town
 jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare
 he owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable
 there is a lady, it seems, a Mrs younge, who was some time ago governess to miss darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what
-"i assure you, i feel it exceedingly," said lady catherine; "i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do
 had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? they could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same
 she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect
 this he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed
" "i think i have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in meryton
 the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd
 "what is Mr darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him? i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing  he may not like to hear
" "oh! you mean jane, i suppose because he danced with her twice
 he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday

 mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached
" elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand
 the strangeness of Mr collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted
 Mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking, mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together
" scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to rosings
 "the conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, i hope, improved in civility
 "what could become of Mr bingley and jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of  their affairs
" "my dear Mr bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother
 neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach

 she had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows

 Mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state

 she directly replied, "you need not be frightened
 Mr collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way
' those were your words
 darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently consented
 "this is an evening of wonders, indeed! and so, darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! so much the better
 did you see it?" bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations
 this matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled
 he was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company
 you have sense, and we all expect you to use it
 Mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield, in the course of three or four months

 she had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance
 her ladyship was highly incensed
 her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms
 "they have both," said she, "been deceived, i dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea
 a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self importance and humility
 at length darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, "Mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his  making friends whether he may be equally capable of  retaining them, is less certain
 the family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them
" "i do assure you, sir, that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man
 since her being at lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy
" during their walk, it was resolved that Mr bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening
 every thing nourishes what is strong already
 from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr collins's side, and as many bows on sir william's, they departed

 sir william lucas, and his daughter maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise
" this was invitation enough
 i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much, and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help
 she became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it
 bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on
 he then handed her in, maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings
" she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted

" "and what is fifty miles of good road? little more than half a day's journey
" the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while
 she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together

 while in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh? are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"

 his behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured

 that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible
 when they had gained their own room, jane taking out the letter, said, "this is from caroline bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal
 he was angry
 jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again
 but i know the foundation is unjust
 the possibility of Mr collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two; but that charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out, "engaged to Mr collins! my dear charlotte, impossible!" the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied, "why should you be surprised, my dear eliza? do you think it incredible that Mr collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?" but elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness
 since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with wickham, he easily learnt, had never been  his design
 it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations
 four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival
 my child, let me not have the grief of seeing  you unable to respect your partner in life

 the other is miss de bourgh
 i want to talk very seriously
 about a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in london; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to ramsgate; and thither also went Mr wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement
 Mr bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase
 Mrs collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me? she finds miss pope a treasure

 if his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,  he was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer
" this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away
 it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations

" on his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said, "did not you think, Mr darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton?" "with great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic

 in his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her
 she had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr darcy, she moved again towards the gate

 miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men
-"you dislike an argument, and want to silence this
" "but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?" "it does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt
 he was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting
 the day passed much as the day before had done
 i expected to find a more reasonable young woman
" to complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia
 my feelings in every respect forbid it
 if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach
 your ladyship wants Mr darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished for promise, make  their marriage at all more probable? supposing him to be attached to me, would  my refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? allow me to say, lady catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged
 there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, i begin to think it perfectly reasonable
 i speak feelingly
" "and have you answered the letter?" said elizabeth
 his circumstances, he assured me, and i had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad
 the morrow produced no abatement of Mrs bennet's ill humour or ill health
 jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart
 "don't keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven's sake! have a little compassion on my nerves
Number
 "wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but i think i shall like  your husband quite as well as jane's
 in a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account
 very few days passed in which Mr collins did not walk to rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours
 it was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention
 the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent
" "and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?" "yes, very handsome
 "and that," said Mrs reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master and very like him
 i have faults enough, but they are not, i hope, of understanding
 i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy
 he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names
" the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share
 perhaps he thought her too young
" from herself to jane from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr darcy's explanation  there, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again
 i am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to  you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me
" "this is no very striking resemblance of your own character, i am sure," said he
" "sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs bennet, alarmed
 when Mr bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn
 he now wished it more than ever
" "i am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness
" this roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once
 if it be not so, let Mr darcy contradict it
 her fellow travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable
 indeed he has no improper pride
 "your examination of Mr darcy is over, i presume," said miss bingley;-"and pray what is the result?" "i am perfectly convinced by it that Mr darcy has no defect
 to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible
 Mrs bennet and kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr collins began
 it was all over before i arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as  your' s seems to have been
 "what could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning" and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him? "not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it
 "i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas
" elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation
 the church  ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church, and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now
" as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as jane
 you blamed me for coming?" "no indeed; i felt nothing but surprise
 will you tell me how long you have loved him?" "it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began
 it is too long ago
 how far your nephew might approve of your interference in  his affairs, i cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine
 i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's
 lady catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable
 that the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other inducements which led me on, i shall not attempt to deny
 she answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more
 many stared
 proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself
 well! i am so happy
 it is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world
 he had been some time with Mr gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning
 in the former were many good paintings; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible
" "Mr bingley does not know Mr wickham himself?" "no; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton
" "it is amazing to me," said bingley, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are
 not that i mean to find fault with  you, for such things i know are all chance in this world
 how could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been
" "are you, indeed? and pray what sort of guardians do you make? does your charge give you much trouble? young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way
 this letter is from Mr collins
  she blushed, and jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour
 no one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection
 it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do
 "i began to be afraid you would never come back again
 her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return
 but you are always giving  her the preference
 i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection
 a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little
 "then, who taught you? who attended to you? without a governess you must have been neglected
 the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen
 elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives
 at present we have nothing to guide us
" upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock
 i told my sister philips so the other day
 but on returning to the drawing room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her
 Mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight
" elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate
" "i think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?" "she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very extensive property
 are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?" "oh, yes! you will only think i feel  more than i ought to do, when i tell you all
 there was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake
 "you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, i am sure, to oblige us for one half hour
 but the case is this
" "an unhappy alternative is before you, elizabeth
 only think what an establishment it would be for one of them
 and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, i am not able to judge; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce
 he knows where we live
 to kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected
 her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house, whichever it might be, where Mr darcy then was
" "miss bingley told me," said jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance
 let me know every thing that i am to know, without delay
 you must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last
 Mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him
 at least, you should not  remind your mother of inviting him
 "do you certainly leave kent on saturday?" said she
 Mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else
 we must have Mrs long and the gouldings soon
 they are all for what they can get
" and though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case
' she did indeed
 she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way
 and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november, for had it been otherwise, i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace
" "already arisen!" repeated Mr bennet
 they met several times, for there was much to be discussed
 Mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on george wickham, who was his god son, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed
 the one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago
 i shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy
 "i have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir
" "and my aunt philips is sure it would do  me a great deal of good," added kitty
 nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight
" darcy smiled and said, "you are perfectly right
 perhaps  she is full young to be much in company
 and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail? we cannot suppose he would help it, if he could
 i never saw such a long chin in my life
 but in matters of greater weight, i may suffer from the want of money
" "yes, she did
 i wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind
 i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly
 if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook, complying with the rules is very easy
" "i am sure  i know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this
" they were all astonished; and Mr bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said, "but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir? you had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness
" miss bennet still looked all amazement
 it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected
 intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done
 elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man
" with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry
 with the gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms
 georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother
 Number
" but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year
 but pride where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation
 wickham will never marry a woman without some money
" "and then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books
" "speak to lizzy about it yourself
 i am prodigiously proud of him
 she followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly! "a man who has once been refused! how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!" she was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying, "is your sister at pemberley still?" "yes, she will remain there till christmas
 she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion
 there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for Mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, lord - and to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him
 our distress, my dear lizzy, is very great
 jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again, elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys
 she wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise
 your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say to you
 the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met
 he bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr darcy, with an expression of half laughing alarm
 "well, lizzy," said Mrs bennet one day, "what is your opinion  now of this sad business of jane's? for my part, i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody
 had she not seen him in derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there  with his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it
" " that is a failing indeed!" cried elizabeth
 chapter xviii
 your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable
 it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance
 they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street
 there is nothing extravagant in  their housekeeping, i dare say
" "we are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply
 "good gracious! lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr darcy! who would have thought it! and is it really true? oh! my sweetest lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! what pin money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! jane's is nothing to it nothing at all
" "remember, eliza, that he does not know jane's disposition as you do
 he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds
 "where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door
 i speak nothing but the truth
 but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?" "will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?" "by all means," cried bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of
" "your picture may be very exact, louisa," said bingley; "but this was all lost upon me
" charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time
" "i assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice
" after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying, "i am astonished at his intimacy with Mr bingley! how can Mr bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? how can they suit each other? do you know Mr bingley?" "not at all
" elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit
" "i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him
 in her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin
 chapter v
 other schemes too came into her head
" and with these words he hastily left the room, and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house
 "can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated
 she could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended
 it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr darcy's proposals

 march was to take elizabeth to hunsford
 i am so grieved for him
 as they walked across the lawn towards the river, elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables
 it had come with a fare from london; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at clapham

 at night she opened her heart to jane
 she cared for none of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of leaving wickham
 it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world
 in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before
 not that i care about it, though
 but why Mr darcy came so often to the parsonage, it was more difficult to understand
 he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him, to lay his private actions open to the world
 very little was said by either; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same

" when the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed
 how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned! his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing
 he is a gentleman; i am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal
 "can it be possible that he will marry her?" "wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her sister
 they were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself
 i shall go distracted
 she dreaded seeing wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible
 "you used us abominably ill," answered Mrs hurst, "in running away without telling us that you were coming out
 my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness, and i confess that i did not expect to receive  more than my due
 i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent
 they both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered
 but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house
 so far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great

" consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr bingley in consequence of it, before  they did
 it was Mr collins's picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest
" she highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her
 Mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them
" then taking the disengaged arm of Mr darcy, she left elizabeth to walk by herself
 there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much

 Mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance
 when they parted, lady catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to hunsford again next year; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both
 he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant
" "that is as it happens
" "i beg your pardon
 she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley's inattention
" elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing room
 but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham

 they agreed that Mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together
 elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him

 i have told miss bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as i have often told her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the piano forte in Mrs jenkinson's room
 Mrs bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing

 but, my dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of  your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend

 Mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well
 the wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this
 "oh! she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld! but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i dare say, very agreeable

" from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr darcy had been over rated, elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs gardiner's long letter, but now, having  that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: "i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, i was too cross to write

 i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you
 he  spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security
 there was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning
 they had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about
" "i am afraid you do not like your pen
" "i should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother
 as he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer
 but Mrs bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which would exactly finish jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before
 she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who often joined them, and good naturedly engaged Mr collins's conversation to herself
 she told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous
" elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop, or lady catherine de bourgh, by venturing to dance

 "he has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! i had not believed it possible
 vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?" Mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply, "do not make yourself uneasy, my love

" elizabeth longed to observe that Mr bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself
 without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment
" but jane could think with certainty on only one point, that Mr bingley, if he  had  been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public
 bingley was the principal spokesman, and miss bennet the principal object

 "only think of its being three months," she cried, "since i went away; it seems but a fortnight i declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time
 how shall we punish him for such a speech?" "nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said elizabeth
 i knew that Mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman

 miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other
" miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection
" "i do, i do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "i love him
 he and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london

 Mr hurst and Mr bingley were at piquet, and Mrs hurst was observing their game
 neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject
 i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies
 why jane you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see Mr bingley
" elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry  her, had she been his relation
 the conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport
 though Mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage
" "you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate
" "i hope not so
 it was unpardonable
 "Mr collins," said she, "speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, i suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman
" she then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two
 with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal
 their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr and Mrs gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner at pemberley, before they left the country
" "this account then is what he has received from Mr darcy
 i must speak to hill, this moment
 all this was acknowledged to Mrs gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:-"i am now convinced, my dear aunt, that i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion, i should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil
 she now lost every expectation of pleasure
 they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable
" "and of your infliction," cried elizabeth with energy
 it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day
 but i am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me! they were excessively sorry to go! but so they always are
 he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband
 Mrs bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces
 whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr collins, was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr bennet were dead
 Mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public
 she saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once
 elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to miss darcy, without calling her attention
 they were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs bennet and kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what elizabeth felt
 he addressed himself directly to miss bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley's salutation

 i cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family
 i was very uncomfortable, i may say unhappy
 "it is nothing in comparison of rosings, my lady, i dare say; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's

 the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to Mr collins
 the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and wickham, who happened to sit near elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies
 lydia the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern
 she enquired into charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry
 lady catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to darcy, "miss bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a london master
 elizabeth looked expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know i am married to day? i was afraid they might not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle, so i was determined he should know it, and so i let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then i bowed and smiled like any thing
 i can recal nothing worse
 the rain continued the whole evening without intermission; jane certainly could not come back
 would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress
 it was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till easter day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening
" "my manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally i assure you
 who  could about such a nasty little freckled thing?" elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of  expression herself, the coarseness of the  sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal! as soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and lydia's purchases, were seated in it
 she opened the door, and met maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out, "oh, my dear eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining room, for there is such a sight to be seen! i will not tell you what it is
 you are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income
 these bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had i with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by every thing

 i did not know before, that i had  two daughters on the brink of matrimony
 Mr bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters
 i do not know who is good enough for him
 it should not be said, that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers
 his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret
 while settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her
" "and quite alone? have all her friends left her?" "Mrs annesley is with her
" elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word
 Mr wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could
 oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him
" "poor wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner
 "and they are really to be married!" cried elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves
 on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects

 "what a letter is this, to be written at such a moment
 elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane, while Mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor
 a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved
 i depend on you for that
" "my dear, you flatter me
" "i can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either
" "certainly
 elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself
 chapter xx
" "complied with! i am only ashamed of his asking so little
" this was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas
 elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been

" "i am not going to run away, papa," said kitty, fretfully; "if  i should ever go to brighton, i would behave better than lydia

 miss bennet, i insist on being satisfied
" elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply
 i am not qualified to form one
 but the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son inlaw, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion
 they called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt
 she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances: and to have Mr collins instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed
 miss bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening  she was his settled choice
 the suspicions which had just arisen of Mr darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love

 but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr bingley will not be detained in london by them
 when i last saw her, she was not very promising
 very nonsensical to come at all! why must  she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? her hair so untidy, so blowsy!" "yes, and her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, i am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office
 she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal
 it was kindly meant
 when the party broke up, lydia returned with Mrs forster to meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning
 those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs forster called her, and they were going to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public
 they followed her into the dining parlour
 such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house
 elizabeth was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes
" "this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west
 in spite of her deeply rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger
 the part which i acted, is now to be explained
" "you need not distress yourself
 she looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend
 but she is nothing to me now
 the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more i think than last year
 he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from  that, i am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before
 having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business
 Mr collins then returned to elizabeth
 is it true?" elizabeth replied that it was
 as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters
 "there has been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way
 "good heaven! what is to become of us! what are we to do!" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe
" "dear madam," cried Mrs hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr gardiner? he has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter

 this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given

 but these things happen so often! a young man, such as you describe Mr bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent
" elizabeth could not but look surprised
 my father supported him at school, and afterwards at cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education
 you tear them to pieces
" they were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good humoured smile, "come, Mr wickham, we are brother and sister, you know
 you must and shall be married by a special licence
 under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief
 the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each
 but the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name
 consider how important every moment is, in such a case
 what a delightful library you have at pemberley, Mr darcy!" "it ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations

"how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to Mr darcy, for now they  do appear wholly undeserved
" "they have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters
 they have each their advantages, and i can be equally happy in either

" "when i wrote that letter," replied darcy, "i believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit
 having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity

 now, seriously, what have you ever known of self denial and dependence? when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?" "these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature
 she had gained her point, and had time to consider of it
 she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out
 how you must have hated me after  that evening?" "hate you! i was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction
 he spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided
" "yes; but he seemed to like his second better
 his coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and i wonder how he could presume to do it
 in ran Mrs bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out, "my dear jane, make haste and hurry down
-"i, who have prided myself on my discernment! i, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust
" "your surprise could not be greater than  mine in being noticed by you
" "i believe her to be both in a great degree," replied wickham; "i have not seen her for many years, but i very well remember that i never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent
 elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her
 he arranges the business just as he pleases
 colonel fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman
 that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr bingley and jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them
 she was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition
 by Mrs hurst and miss bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments
 the rest of the evening passed with the  appearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again
 don't think me angry, however, for i only mean to let you know, that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on  your side
 what did colonel forster say? had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place? they must have seen them together for ever
 thank god! i have not  that pain
 are you going much farther?" "no, i should have turned in a moment
 his doing so drew her notice
 if, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's, i can only say that i am sorry
 she received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice
 but on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away
" occupied in observing Mr bingley's attentions to her sister, elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend
 his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure
 upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward
 how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine
 had she merely  dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal
 she read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes
 instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as elizabeth half expected Mr bingley to do, he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's visit
 she answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "when you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance
" "i am talking of possibilities, charles
 "why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?" she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure
 but this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr darcy walk into the room

 her ease and good spirits increased
" "my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents

 james's, sir william was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look
 she assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her
 dearest lizzy, i hardly know what i would write, but i have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed
 and his behaviour, so strikingly altered, what could it mean? that he should even speak to her was amazing! but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting
" "not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise
 at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration
" he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend
 but i will not repine
 it cannot be done too much; and when i next write to her, i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account
" "oh! yes," said elizabeth  drily"Mr darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him
 i shall offer to pay him to morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter
 "there  is something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming

 she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation
 while she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes
 the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family
" "oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!" "perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister
 seriously, i would have you be on your guard
 after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?" "and we mean to treat you all," added lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there
 "do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain
 she practises very constantly
 no sooner did he appear, than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room
 Mr collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family
 to my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men
 the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball and at this ball, what do you think he did? he danced only four dances! i am sorry to pain you but so it was
" "that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline," cried her  brother"because he does  not write with ease
 they gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound

 he was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother inlaw, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could
 darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure
" "when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had no reason, i suppose, to believe them fond of each other
 you are not going to be  missish, i hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report
" "care of him! yes, i really believe darcy  does take care of him in those points where he most wants care
 elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more
 Mr darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them
 but it is all, all too late now
 i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on
 the apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts

 such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr bingley's continued absence

 darcy took up a book; miss bingley did the same; and Mrs hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss bennet
