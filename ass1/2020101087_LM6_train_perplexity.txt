 a yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. 4.966130912894032
 he held the bowl aloft and intoned: — introibo ad altare  dei. 7.15196463333337
 halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:  come up, kinch! come up, you fearful jesuit! solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. 10.359222844958653
 he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains. 6.213141680928351
 then, catching sight of stephen dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head. 10.86487803189363
 stephen dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak. 18.13264047623806
 buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly. 2.7874680036133315
  back to barracks! he said sternly. 1.7675828597479626
 he added in a preacher’s tone:  for this, o dearly beloved, is the genuine christine: body and soul and blood and ouns. 15.698906686352913
 slow music, please. 1.334843874899295
 shut your eyes, gents. 1.4696432985398717
 one moment. 1.0
 a little trouble about those white corpuscles. 2.702712552020508
 silence, all. 1.4723213650124218
 he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points. 6.817835200588048
 two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm. 2.5129740184264406
  thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. 7.254921577244694
 that will do nicely. 1.164427848950947
 switch off the current, will you? he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown. 7.785935951520712
 the plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. 5.752643322838642
 a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips. 1.5946540735747938
  the mockery of it! he said gaily. 1.8829060536043238
 your absurd name, an ancient greek! he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself. 4.116348150371465
 stephen dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck. 11.994399992839373
 buck mulligan’s gay voice went on. 1.1939579920942052
  my name is absurd too: malachi mulligan, two dactyls. 2.909575668091492
 but it has a hellenic ring, hasn’t it? tripping and sunny like the buck himself. 5.326280942684204
 we must go to athens. 1.4669552625943882
 will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid? he laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:  will he come? the jejune jesuit! ceasing, he began to shave with care. 9.660974390041131
  tell me, mulligan, stephen said quietly. 2.6025259375874774
  yes, my love?  how long is haines going to stay in this tower? buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder. 5.09567758429946
  god, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly. 5.695600599656385
 a ponderous saxon. 1.0700328147886808
 he thinks you’re not a gentleman. 1.2958397643114985
 god, these bloody english! bursting with money and indigestion. 6.618429834574494
 because he comes from oxford. 1.1372532526741017
 you know, dedalus, you have the real oxford manner. 2.8487374624429798
 he can’t make you out. 1.715975809112019
 o, my name for you is the best: kinch, the knife blade. 5.172007052746351
 he shaved warily over his chin. 1.1935779255005474
  he was raving all night about a black panther, stephen said. 3.257638203975162
 where is his guncase?  a woful lunatic! mulligan said. 3.230344066299741
 were you in a funk?  i was, stephen said with energy and growing fear. 6.739851633630273
 out here in the dark with a man i don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther. 7.0152141819776945
 you saved men from drowning. 1.4357796653365515
 i’m not a hero, however. 1.2333062375176398
 if he stays on here i am off. 3.5476148101945473
 buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. 1.516176154310557
 he hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily. 5.815740659639586
  scutter! he cried thickly. 2.672693134529671
 he came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into stephen’s upper pocket, said:  lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor. 6.804394707024357
 stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief. 4.489991125286599
 buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly. 1.0219696109048748
 then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:  the bard’s noserag! a new art colour for our irish poets: snotgreen. 5.762918147341996
 you can almost taste it, can’t you? he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly. 7.3914805448211105
  god! he said quietly. 2.5144549479929825
 isn’t the sea what algy calls it: a great sweet mother? the snotgreen sea. 7.931900508997958
 the scrotumtightening sea. 3.6415060571230837
  epi oinopa  ponton. 2.018078973121994
 ah, dedalus, the greeks! i must teach you. 2.9054346289607205
 you must read them in the original. 1.407043991505394
  thalatta! thalatta!_ she is our great sweet mother. 4.043590013293594
 come and look. 1.1731923176310615
 stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. 2.2895022559334346
 leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of kingstown. 5.489226337167732
  our mighty mother! buck mulligan said. 1.2315928465664292
 he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephen’s face. 4.756146980900101
  the aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. 1.537620978209386
 that’s why she won’t let me have anything to do with you. 3.2844300294825177
  someone killed her, stephen said gloomily. 2.690588880273847
  you could have knelt down, damn it, kinch, when your dying mother asked you, buck mulligan said. 7.10735408341073
 i’m hyperborean as much as you. 5.727808661717268
 but to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her. 4.03085060751916
 and you refused. 2.7368491005510798
 there is something sinister in you. 5.364857569052678
 he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. 5.278993761861605
 a tolerant smile curled his lips. 2.3270457866987204
  but a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. 2.166570108211734
 kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all! he shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously. 9.784947167799052
 stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat sleeve. 5.179817099643666
 pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. 5.507314594392588
 silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes. 9.73176798356747
 across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. 6.044508391565314
 the ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. 4.0261502130079565
 a bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting. 7.320492988480167
 buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade. 2.1790686589755537
  ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. 2.708653896702942
 i must give you a shirt and a few noserags. 2.8166352322539434
 how are the secondhand breeks?  they fit well enough, stephen answered. 3.2692712802797965
 buck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip. 3.045516318478201
  the mockery of it, he said contentedly. 3.4397822438550443
 secondleg they should be. 1.2971093491527526
 god knows what poxy bowsy left them off. 5.997341919737833
 i have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey. 4.097239530597597
 you’ll look spiffing in them. 2.661811547132866
 i’m not joking, kinch. 1.8351379828622394
 you look damn well when you’re dressed. 1.8834004409185219
  thanks, stephen said. 4.47991590381378
 i can’t wear them if they are grey. 2.15912972947503
  he can’t wear them, buck mulligan told his face in the mirror. 2.2827592236207086
 etiquette is etiquette. 2.205257604690703
 he kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers. 2.973229348539373
 he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin. 5.893379216661595
 stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes. 7.33933505932584
  that fellow i was with in the ship last night, said buck mulligan, says you have g. 6.914930177920959
 he’s up in dottyville with connolly norman. 3.4947060064169637
 general paralysis of the insane! he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea. 10.605677776177183
 his curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth. 7.263271245091281
 laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk. 2.477982662804903
  look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack. 4.718276434653782
 hair on end. 1.0612499326164286
 as he and others see me. 1.888289738051487
 who chose this face for me? this dogsbody to rid of vermin. 3.0045361052242097
 it asks me too. 1.2441111040077706
  i pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, buck mulligan said. 3.388174934937209
 it does her all right. 2.972804897554893
 the aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for malachi. 3.6807911440666756
 lead him not into temptation. 3.330445086361107
 and her name is ursula. 1.7025456590119115
 laughing again, he brought the mirror away from stephen’s peering eyes. 3.189197753542761
  the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. 4.696243904874518
 if wilde were only alive to see you! drawing back and pointing, stephen said with bitterness:  it is a symbol of irish art. 4.004187378535954
 the cracked lookingglass of a servant. 1.1087626804449595
 buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephen’s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them. 6.798974687286246
  it’s not fair to tease you like that, kinch, is it? he said kindly. 4.404020747518905
 god knows you have more spirit than any of them. 5.781795224586368
 parried again. 1.0
 he fears the lancet of my art as i fear that of his. 5.513305720509337
 the cold steel pen. 1.5488820648405748
  cracked lookingglass of a servant! tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea. 6.677900615069909
 he’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman. 3.332985119970822
 his old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to zulus or some bloody swindle or other. 4.675022867216042
 god, kinch, if you and i could only work together we might do something for the island. 7.299639023337871
 hellenise it. 1.0
 cranly’s arm. 1.0
 his arm. 1.0
  and to think of your having to beg from these swine. 3.585329097432109
 i’m the only one that knows what you are. 3.3318976980508244
 why don’t you trust me more? what have you up your nose against me? is it haines? if he makes any noise here i’ll bring down seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave clive kempthorpe. 8.827864544671785
 young shouts of moneyed voices in clive kempthorpe’s rooms. 3.608585632407853
 palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. 5.30455909366362
 o, i shall expire! break the news to her gently, aubrey! i shall die! with slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by ades of magdalen with the tailor’s shears. 20.784038821495468
 a scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade. 4.448407533288383
 i don’t want to be debagged! don’t you play the giddy ox with me! shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. 6.578973013031918
 a deaf gardener, aproned, masked with matthew arnold’s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms. 13.686360845071533
 to ourselves. 1.0
 new paganism. 1.0
  let him stay, stephen said. 1.687481693512108
 there’s nothing wrong with him except at night. 1.683043325585391
  then what is it? buck mulligan asked impatiently. 1.7276966384122205
 cough it up. 1.675408005856187
 i’m quite frank with you. 1.5086920445779373
 what have you against me now? they halted, looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale. 5.465034027128372
 stephen freed his arm quietly. 1.0738438252645168
  do you wish me to tell you? he asked. 3.835261175615041
  yes, what is it? buck mulligan answered. 1.6993991956877301
 i don’t remember anything. 1.1482313682484382
 he looked in stephen’s face as he spoke. 1.6895415409597885
 a light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes. 7.712257410382955
 stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:  do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mother’s death? buck mulligan frowned quickly and said:  what? where? i can’t remember anything. 8.0463065515422
 i remember only ideas and sensations. 1.4567785161671312
 why? what happened in the name of god?  you were making tea, stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water. 4.45238951413515
 your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom. 3.701241529395437
 she asked you who was in your room. 1.4046547638974263
  yes? buck mulligan said. 1.2510096792826475
 what did i say? i forget. 2.8442402266840423
  you said, stephen answered,  o, it’s only dedalus whose mother is beastly dead. 5.274026762303445
_ a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck mulligan’s cheek. 6.722221550044951
  did i say that? he asked. 2.556404044584649
 well? what harm is that? he shook his constraint from him nervously. 3.1466702245601637
  and what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? you saw only your mother die. 11.783503459088937
 i see them pop off every day in the mater and richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. 4.306031678216993
 it’s a beastly thing and nothing else. 2.195340615997033
 it simply doesn’t matter. 1.2630895862747091
 you wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. 3.1828088304703477
 why? because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected the wrong way. 8.31367651905444
 to me it’s all a mockery and beastly. 2.1091729821453162
 her cerebral lobes are not functioning. 3.3459693664118104
 she calls the doctor sir peter teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt. 6.141416265705853
 humour her till it’s over. 3.351343535208724
 you crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because i don’t whinge like some hired mute from lalouette’s. 8.221398156651961
 absurd! i suppose i did say it. 4.973610516907554
 i didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother. 1.7598283462886284
 he had spoken himself into boldness. 1.487305776939992
 stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:  i am not thinking of the offence to my mother. 11.690361193038196
  of what then? buck mulligan asked. 1.9551124658732708
  of the offence to me, stephen answered. 1.9314775642758422
 buck mulligan swung round on his heel. 1.4601597841500618
  o, an impossible person! he exclaimed. 1.5773726149306277
 he walked off quickly round the parapet. 1.8314476997781532
 stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. 2.8092927631449545
 sea and headland now grew dim. 2.6134168529849267
 pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks. 5.234725378208581
 a voice within the tower called loudly:  are you up there, mulligan?  i’m coming, buck mulligan answered. 5.181982962790984
 he turned towards stephen and said:  look at the sea. 2.092885456460322
 what does it care about offences? chuck loyola, kinch, and come on down. 5.118342159777532
 the sassenach wants his morning rashers. 3.9141929793775083
 his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof:  don’t mope over it all day, he said. 6.795315622134622
 i’m inconsequent. 1.0
 give up the moody brooding. 1.256042313690619
 his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead: and no more turn aside and brood upon love’s bitter mystery for fergus rules the brazen cars. 5.176424522918138
 woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed. 4.665477948447265
 inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. 6.2055393449312195
 white breast of the dim sea. 6.540603669891502
 the twining stresses, two by two. 5.105177565278491
 a hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords. 5.543356824123579
 wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide. 3.1200677997604664
 a cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green. 4.592647552087084
 it lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. 2.3399130604004954
 fergus’ song: i sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. 4.355088754053068
 her door was open: she wanted to hear my music. 3.38928364098735
 silent with awe and pity i went to her bedside. 3.931565482067287
 she was crying in her wretched bed. 1.3016344593700215
 for those words, stephen: love’s bitter mystery. 1.5692869054518999
 where now? her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. 10.345933298053733
 a birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl. 2.9890064973668973
 she heard old royce sing in the pantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang: i am the boy that can enjoy invisibility. 13.6556936808974
 phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed. 2.9337187634317083
 and no more turn aside and brood. 1.5621061739107769
 folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. 2.916260406718841
 memories beset his brooding brain. 2.3487431233858995
 her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament. 2.5611123006602803
 a cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. 10.938382045934157
 her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts. 6.1774753098745245
 in a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes. 7.969723766257237
 her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. 6.547170764643833
 on me alone. 1.049003232028056
 the ghostcandle to light her agony. 4.52882166827042
 ghostly light on the tortured face. 3.309000152186352
 her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees. 3.3594768255129464
 her eyes on me to strike me down. 2.923684522252821
  liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat. 9.57065190854755
_ ghoul! chewer of corpses! no, mother! let me be and let me live. 6.975756086212668
  kinch ahoy! buck mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower. 4.297806670283718
 it came nearer up the staircase, calling again. 2.1176402223753006
 stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words. 7.07554095992961
  dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. 3.501634124071563
 breakfast is ready. 1.0257204291544308
 haines is apologising for waking us last night. 2.6686198170025657
 it’s all right. 1.1146191026048522
  i’m coming, stephen said, turning. 2.3661950151785023
  do, for jesus’ sake, buck mulligan said. 3.6212275123233364
 for my sake and for all our sakes. 2.339476315988314
 his head disappeared and reappeared. 1.9231558785565295
  i told him your symbol of irish art. 1.708137099151964
 he says it’s very clever. 1.2954066333402172
 touch him for a quid, will you? a guinea, i mean. 3.4869521563660033
  i get paid this morning, stephen said. 1.829932237647667
  the school kip? buck mulligan said. 1.0877883716568575
 how much? four quid? lend us one. 2.0649318884653094
  if you want it, stephen said. 1.9816495823630613
  four shining sovereigns, buck mulligan cried with delight. 2.380852057369515
 we’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. 3.290192032389528
 four omnipotent sovereigns. 40.9785035027147
 he flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a cockney accent: o, won’t we have a merry time, drinking whisky, beer and wine! on coronation, coronation day! o, won’t we have a merry time on coronation day! warm sunshine merrying over the sea. 10.326485365579089
 the nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet. 3.921481602011934
 why should i bring it down? or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship? he went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. 12.355334014323258
 so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes. 2.8474854564923726
 i am another now and yet the same. 3.343226447126897
 a servant too. 1.0318133591654384
 a server of a servant. 1.1975425250118779
 in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow. 9.407303207822432
 two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning. 10.322337408621511
  we’ll be choked, buck mulligan said. 1.8729921356363877
 haines, open that door, will you? stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. 7.241855354776018
 a tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors. 3.9310590486231973
  have you the key? a voice asked. 1.7456206414665496
  dedalus has it, buck mulligan said. 2.0812016965248192
 janey mack, i’m choked! he howled, without looking up from the fire:  kinch!  it’s in the lock, stephen said, coming forward. 7.922276051647695
 the key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. 7.02203472361383
 haines stood at the doorway, looking out. 1.665410474817453
 stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait. 5.833992579426626
 buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him. 2.2096390511728736
 then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief. 4.025509799979113
  i’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when. 4.916602900369666
 but, hush! not a word more on that subject! kinch, wake up! bread, butter, honey. 9.18720044984509
 haines, come in. 3.3920720934670086
 the grub is ready. 1.0269603748562124
 bless us, o lord, and these thy gifts. 3.351559743389911
 where’s the sugar? o, jay, there’s no milk. 3.1847550149495887
 stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker. 4.2324326875363685
 buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet. 1.2716572021513008
  what sort of a kip is this? he said. 2.021134205994374
 i told her to come after eight. 1.7154417271112405
  we can drink it black, stephen said thirstily. 2.6130541706319677
 there’s a lemon in the locker. 1.4022615793141147
  o, damn you and your paris fads! buck mulligan said. 2.9475025562187263
 i want sandycove milk. 4.041214990048573
 haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:  that woman is coming up with the milk. 5.640252587129061
  the blessings of god on you! buck mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair. 3.5109486949692377
 sit down. 1.0
 pour out the tea there. 1.6727400546913986
 the sugar is in the bag. 1.540855077755505
 here, i can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs. 2.3935312680380596
 he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying: — in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti. 5.8460430411300495
_ haines sat down to pour out the tea. 1.6236668136458143
  i’m giving you two lumps each, he said. 2.3305339678365335
 but, i say, mulligan, you do make strong tea, don’t you? buck mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman’s wheedling voice:  when i makes tea i makes tea, as old mother grogan said. 12.81243443112001
 and when i makes water i makes water. 3.096001643796124
  by jove, it is tea, haines said. 2.7862498217541707
 buck mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: — so i do, mrs cahill,_ says she. 4.399307829937348
  begob, ma’am,_ says mrs cahill,  god send you don’t make them in the one pot. 6.06854452472606
_ he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife. 4.594110713523164
  that’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, haines. 4.11949598294753
 five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of dundrum. 6.0155078137737075
 printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind. 4.2093653284101515
 he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows:  can you recall, brother, is mother grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads?  i doubt it, said stephen gravely. 19.060752799053596
  do you now? buck mulligan said in the same tone. 1.7106255577544485
 your reasons, pray?  i fancy, stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the mabinogion. 8.083295629751554
 mother grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of mary ann. 5.105719144395792
 buck mulligan’s face smiled with delight. 1.2754029664145925
  charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly. 6.352969823967486
 do you think she was? quite charming! then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: _ for old mary ann she doesn’t care a damn. 11.8861096464781
 but, hising up her petticoats. 4.120230657219916
_ he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned. 2.2470485918418945
 the doorway was darkened by an entering form. 1.7874767219089374
  the milk, sir!  come in, ma’am, mulligan said. 6.04733575825957
 kinch, get the jug. 3.9598879271364744
 an old woman came forward and stood by stephen’s elbow. 1.8082291587229191
  that’s a lovely morning, sir, she said. 1.7717908396887874
 glory be to god. 1.8042737230464265
  to whom? mulligan said, glancing at her. 1.9180031112491263
 ah, to be sure! stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker. 3.3109552881241573
  the islanders, mulligan said to haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces. 10.040340255194687
  how much, sir? asked the old woman. 2.2696486312007447
  a quart, stephen said. 1.3286432286400744
 he watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers. 4.075917746578482
 old shrunken paps. 1.0601060376686753
 she poured again a measureful and a tilly. 2.7532111972620905
 old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger. 6.031301758362394
 she praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out. 3.2481118947613195
 crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. 8.704754205866243
 they lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. 3.633202873593796
 silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times. 8.550015992565342
 a wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. 11.463066506203642
 to serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour. 5.603525834620057
  it is indeed, ma’am, buck mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups. 2.433896880588233
  taste it, sir, she said. 3.1794119989291745
 he drank at her bidding. 1.1150019730555063
  if we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts. 4.663158592033379
 living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits. 8.6031320803309
  are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked. 2.1016193236546865
  i am, ma’am, buck mulligan answered. 2.3313472830268154
  look at that now, she said. 1.7939782550468224
 stephen listened in scornful silence. 2.0573917182129366
 she bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights. 12.72797781625295
 to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in god’s likeness, the serpent’s prey. 15.468704387336563
 and to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes. 5.281909125325269
  do you understand what he says? stephen asked her. 3.400107733116738
  is it french you are talking, sir? the old woman said to haines. 3.894085533228836
 haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently. 3.7840294366416303
  irish, buck mulligan said. 2.9266947932340983
 is there gaelic on you?  i thought it was irish, she said, by the sound of it. 5.046409305649425
 are you from the west, sir?  i am an englishman, haines answered. 3.114005603244355
  he’s english, buck mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak irish in ireland. 2.494649883013232
  sure we ought to, the old woman said, and i’m ashamed i don’t speak the language myself. 4.999196736441117
 i’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows. 2.8518552111150175
  grand is no name for it, said buck mulligan. 4.135234032072006
 wonderful entirely. 1.0
 fill us out some more tea, kinch. 2.1048489775002643
 would you like a cup, ma’am?  no, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go. 6.290285886169897
 haines said to her:  have you your bill? we had better pay her, mulligan, hadn’t we? stephen filled again the three cups. 8.83194429206553
  bill, sir? she said, halting. 4.7931454286259925
 well, it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. 9.59943844208633
 that’s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir. 6.99151764746
 buck mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets. 5.901964918150175
  pay up and look pleasant, haines said to him, smiling. 7.567831060925286
 stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk. 6.467688198604131
 buck mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried:  a miracle! he passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:  ask nothing more of me, sweet. 10.812459174355707
 all i can give you i give. 3.6644004186451515
 stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand. 3.6753883350128906
  we’ll owe twopence, he said. 1.2762972936027448
  time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. 2.4546358794435394
 time enough. 1.0
 good morning, sir. 2.1510896971123072
 she curtseyed and went out, followed by buck mulligan’s tender chant: _ heart of my heart, were it more, more would be laid at your feet. 8.823790592528411
_ he turned to stephen and said:  seriously, dedalus. 3.6590107925806694
 i’m stony. 1.0
 hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money. 4.543867678771298
 today the bards must drink and junket. 3.7970087912066677
 ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty. 4.961049579648013
  that reminds me, haines said, rising, that i have to visit your national library today. 3.35091131463837
  our swim first, buck mulligan said. 2.1743620420062726
 he turned to stephen and asked blandly:  is this the day for your monthly wash, kinch? then he said to haines:  the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month. 9.973370151399124
  all ireland is washed by the gulfstream, stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf. 3.7549043395278723
 haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:  i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me. 8.022920858334858
 speaking to me. 2.095975620268991
 they wash and tub and scrub. 2.3315605848664256
 agenbite of inwit. 1.334984821608657
 yet here’s a spot. 1.2425226141250831
  that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of irish art is deuced good. 5.884312866546795
 buck mulligan kicked stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone:  wait till you hear him on hamlet, haines. 3.9079823421010795
  well, i mean it, haines said, still speaking to stephen. 5.383579003352955
 i was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in. 3.1581215879498155
  would i make any money by it? stephen asked. 2.7847375940458807
 haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said:  i don’t know, i’m sure. 4.735577029505745
 he strolled out to the doorway. 1.1413882574426608
 buck mulligan bent across to stephen and said with coarse vigour:  you put your hoof in it now. 3.8555235703112722
 what did you say that for?  well? stephen said. 4.349565633031725
 the problem is to get money. 1.634306968363041
 from whom? from the milkwoman or from him. 3.7613656335694152
 it’s a toss up, i think. 1.4418717312382183
  i blow him out about you, buck mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes. 5.205404295289442
  i see little hope, stephen said, from her or from him. 6.759858172937943
 buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephen’s arm. 3.957587489556742
  from me, kinch, he said. 2.4521403108417434
 in a suddenly changed tone he added:  to tell you the god’s truth i think you’re right. 4.760351877295434
 damn all else they are good for. 3.512707153406651
 why don’t you play them as i do? to hell with them all. 4.6029455983378975
 let us get out of the kip. 1.304361106041867
 he stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly:  mulligan is stripped of his garments. 4.575715389253283
 he emptied his pockets on to the table. 3.4549740993634743
  there’s your snotrag, he said. 2.4601277277852147
 and putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. 6.889176075963917
 his hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. 3.3743621072994614
 god, we’ll simply have to dress the character. 5.450728089628565
 i want puce gloves and green boots. 3.105044918663321
 do i contradict myself? very well then, i contradict myself. 6.298237706753975
 mercurial malachi. 1.0
 a limp black missile flew out of his talking hands. 6.092437281248601
  and there’s your latin quarter hat, he said. 1.6754487593171106
 stephen picked it up and put it on. 4.619734129863859
 haines called to them from the doorway:  are you coming, you fellows?  i’m ready, buck mulligan answered, going towards the door. 6.288150462871184
 come out, kinch. 1.211366623167307
 you have eaten all we left, i suppose. 2.5505658041001444
 resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:  and going forth he met butterly. 7.006099699453622
 stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it. 8.603012550986426
 he put the huge key in his inner pocket. 1.9294993518629757
 at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked:  did you bring the key?  i have it, stephen said, preceding them. 5.591695978674436
 he walked on. 1.013299424222328
 behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses. 4.7279807521507164
  down, sir! how dare you, sir! haines asked:  do you pay rent for this tower?  twelve quid, buck mulligan said. 6.06586322891266
  to the secretary of state for war, stephen added over his shoulder. 2.9554539419410397
 they halted while haines surveyed the tower and said at last:  rather bleak in wintertime, i should say. 8.690315647798048
 martello you call it?  billy pitt had them built, buck mulligan said, when the french were on the sea. 5.562386031582711
 but ours is the  omphalos. 1.5449663385771677
  what is your idea of hamlet? haines asked stephen. 3.0216475134230034
  no, no, buck mulligan shouted in pain. 2.347713206590672
 i’m not equal to thomas aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. 4.27125186982622
 wait till i have a few pints in me first. 2.0006657826182415
 he turned to stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat:  you couldn’t manage it under three pints, kinch, could you?  it has waited so long, stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer. 9.903471064514477
  you pique my curiosity, haines said amiably. 3.1025250784109915
 is it some paradox?  pooh! buck mulligan said. 2.161749780787955
 we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes. 2.3713252907401503
 it’s quite simple. 1.163519791049636
 he proves by algebra that hamlet’s grandson is shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father. 7.164773564760946
  what? haines said, beginning to point at stephen. 1.5503224704170682
 he himself? buck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to stephen’s ear:  o, shade of kinch the elder! japhet in search of a father!  we’re always tired in the morning, stephen said to haines. 12.085785681178768
 and it is rather long to tell. 2.5039356292054737
 buck mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands. 3.6121156508973367
  the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus, he said. 5.362967554081126
  i mean to say, haines explained to stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore. 8.651403158230686
  that beetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it? buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not speak. 4.253006301039704
 in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires. 3.6786292928700535
  it’s a wonderful tale, haines said, bringing them to halt again. 2.5612658946448996
 eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent. 9.576188957398902
 the seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the muglins. 8.827067132368438
  i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused. 4.8302169251929215
 the father and the son idea. 2.297929200342459
 the son striving to be atoned with the father. 7.237108174252652
 buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. 6.0773790726326755
 he looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. 10.148411368700616
 he moved a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: _ i’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard. 10.227430281328234
 my mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird. 2.857986495956838
 with joseph the joiner i cannot agree. 1.8423372470041968
 so here’s to disciples and calvary. 2.306896692234718
_ he held up a forefinger of warning. 1.5067204983749036
 _ if anyone thinks that i amn’t divine he’ll get no free drinks when i’m making the wine but have to drink water and wish it were plain that i make when the wine becomes water again. 12.036544563826162
_ he tugged swiftly at stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: _ goodbye, now, goodbye! write down all i said and tell tom, dick and harry i rose from the dead. 15.962170017737536
 what’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly and olivet’s breezy. 3.6812404453839003
 goodbye, now, goodbye!_ he capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries. 12.905529351298581
 haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside stephen and said:  we oughtn’t to laugh, i suppose. 6.586134298656234
 he’s rather blasphemous. 1.170990622203639
 i’m not a believer myself, that is to say. 2.774500116680499
 still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn’t it? what did he call it? joseph the joiner?  the ballad of joking jesus, stephen answered. 7.330479103084647
  o, haines said, you have heard it before?  three times a day, after meals, stephen said drily. 6.396102487320818
  you’re not a believer, are you? haines asked. 2.8676698363855593
 i mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word. 2.178552577322365
 creation from nothing and miracles and a personal god. 3.6490505757295613
  there’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, stephen said. 3.153390137733551
 haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone. 5.033619388575106
 he sprang it open with his thumb and offered it. 2.531408682972803
  thank you, stephen said, taking a cigarette. 2.0718171530142664
 haines helped himself and snapped the case to. 1.888014703820791
 he put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards stephen in the shell of his hands. 13.237412315263876
  yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. 3.25871594416654
 either you believe or you don’t, isn’t it? personally i couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal god. 7.612756519695998
 you don’t stand for that, i suppose?  you behold in me, stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought. 7.692124930730497
 he walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side. 3.9739967232712217
 its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. 3.5995593727227204
 my familiar, after me, calling, steeeeeeeeeeeephen! a wavering line along the path. 6.301986093819176
 they will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. 2.979505466903888
 he wants that key. 1.3139696826558505
 it is mine. 1.0115675397615935
 i paid the rent. 1.112612641536799
 now i eat his salt bread. 1.2752017113382519
 give him the key too. 1.3558625390249408
 he will ask for it. 1.9837356382328863
 that was in his eyes. 1.1153677604743448
  after all, haines began. 3.6346243052509246
 stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind. 6.354501168753891
  after all, i should think you are able to free yourself. 2.4561341015357714
 you are your own master, it seems to me. 1.9713289933798899
  i am a servant of two masters, stephen said, an english and an italian. 3.039573367960021
  italian? haines said. 1.3847631805987553
 a crazy queen, old and jealous. 3.187128843676786
 kneel down before me. 3.3035488051124835
  and a third, stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs. 6.625657680536318
  italian? haines said again. 1.4397674105601297
 what do you mean?  the imperial british state, stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy roman catholic and apostolic church. 3.660637234467772
 haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke. 4.257841349725747
  i can quite understand that, he said calmly. 2.8836475465198435
 an irishman must think like that, i daresay. 4.072755402070312
 we feel in england that we have treated you rather unfairly. 4.858788080275729
 it seems history is to blame. 1.788809463292686
 the proud potent titles clanged over stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells:  et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars. 17.26649056644937
 symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs. 17.920595228252616
 a horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: photius and the brood of mockers of whom mulligan was one, and arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the son with the father, and valentine, spurning christ’s terrene body, and the subtle african heresiarch sabellius who held that the father was himself his own son. 30.912060406070374
 words mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger. 3.279160773186174
 idle mockery. 1.0
 the void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, michael’s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields. 18.72476879531551
 hear, hear! prolonged applause. 4.153929233567142
  zut! nom de dieu!_  of course i’m a britisher, haines’s voice said, and i feel as one. 8.534721252103722
 i don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of german jews either. 2.490651947530267
 that’s our national problem, i’m afraid, just now. 2.073325640417195
 two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman. 3.4538866079063726
  she’s making for bullock harbour. 2.6742048174584063
 the boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain. 2.8313894465228513
  there’s five fathoms out there, he said. 1.5479147749336268
 it’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one. 4.852530280109181
 it’s nine days today. 1.5413607043964705
 the man that was drowned. 1.3835020789876096
 a sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite. 8.143951687830803
 here i am. 1.0455940170284714
 they followed the winding path down to the creek. 1.7996628930926302
 buck mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder. 5.417263358420114
 a young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water. 10.105506482036317
  is the brother with you, malachi?  down in westmeath. 8.312231227211386
 with the bannons. 1.02991544781343
  still there? i got a card from bannon. 1.8991221144096622
 says he found a sweet young thing down there. 3.237152762190528
 photo girl he calls her. 1.2569614099717854
  snapshot, eh? brief exposure. 2.6721145055007
 buck mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. 2.0947149460495567
 an elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face. 3.507850916000242
 he scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth. 21.054289330373354
 buck mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at haines and stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone. 15.883106025697357
  seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock. 5.522651499610546
 chucked medicine and going in for the army. 3.543070934341867
  ah, go to god! buck mulligan said. 3.75783722558086
  going over next week to stew. 3.2122817699531607
 you know that red carlisle girl, lily?  yes. 2.665214736856701
  spooning with him last night on the pier. 2.6103341422598643
 the father is rotto with money. 2.589636110607764
  is she up the pole?  better ask seymour that. 3.569155917784687
  seymour a bleeding officer! buck mulligan said. 2.4172734363288653
 he nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely:  redheaded women buck like goats. 7.689803309153431
 he broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt. 4.273061235644053
  my twelfth rib is gone, he cried. 5.472791335017873
 i’m the  übermensch. 1.0323436057988624
_ toothless kinch and i, the supermen. 3.585846157640311
 he struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay. 5.694438860886173
  are you going in here, malachi?  yes. 2.0483830180460187
 make room in the bed. 1.5252308259398375
 the young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. 4.579547765175607
 haines sat down on a stone, smoking. 1.5403179130752804
  are you not coming in? buck mulligan asked. 2.8281012188163324
  later on, haines said. 10.880811753822393
 not on my breakfast. 1.1593930931813117
 stephen turned away. 1.0922161351894117
  i’m going, mulligan, he said. 3.7828279327291696
  give us that key, kinch, buck mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat. 3.6141023666869363
 stephen handed him the key. 1.434007541998683
 buck mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes. 1.7231894518015844
  and twopence, he said, for a pint. 2.2315804121469554
 throw it there. 1.2041621052949665
 stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. 1.7149269411202186
 dressing, undressing. 1.1673078565610906
 buck mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:  he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord. 6.0858049360659425
 thus spake zarathustra. 1.1498948784149443
 his plump body plunged. 1.3167477697867607
  we’ll see you again, haines said, turning as stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild irish. 4.3830413946928415
 horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a saxon. 7.014152392817387
  the ship, buck mulligan cried. 1.1310739153939737
 half twelve. 1.0
  good, stephen said. 5.847559076979863
 he walked along the upwardcurving path. 1.8467536506597289
 liliata rutilantium. 1.0
 turma circumdet. 1.0
 iubilantium te virginum. 1.03831095988985
 the priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. 4.142612242099974
 i will not sleep here tonight. 2.7696560260624516
 home also i cannot go. 1.9157515758010375
 a voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. 3.680990460085606
 turning the curve he waved his hand. 2.3181253059221114
 it called again. 1.1693651738585824
 a sleek brown head, a seal’s, far out on the water, round. 4.724232505059507
  you, cochrane, what city sent for him?  tarentum, sir. 6.366536891654969
  very good. 1.0
 well?  there was a battle, sir. 2.3115831024143296
  very good. 1.0
 where? the boy’s blank face asked the blank window. 4.465122748133464
 fabled by the daughters of memory. 2.8103157440759756
 and yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it. 7.581909890323115
 a phrase, then, of impatience, thud of blake’s wings of excess. 6.674963445828447
 i hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame. 8.104937406013264
 what’s left us then?  i forget the place, sir. 3.8680819705155063
 Number b. 1.0
  asculum, stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book. 3.1420875837979643
  yes, sir. 1.0230423539818776
 and he said:  another victory like that and we are done for. 4.944416168327851
_ that phrase the world had remembered. 2.6102585259429376
 a dull ease of the mind. 2.1218933534962123
 from a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear. 4.278344554250873
 any general to any officers. 2.823170138025021
 they lend ear. 1.0679105504702109
  you, armstrong, stephen said. 3.549461431032955
 what was the end of pyrrhus?  end of pyrrhus, sir?  i know, sir. 4.372243147053205
 ask me, sir, comyn said. 2.05233855313438
 you, armstrong. 1.0828486334938527
 do you know anything about pyrrhus? a bag of figrolls lay snugly in armstrong’s satchel. 3.845097353538453
 he curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. 3.4978422708885457
 crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips. 2.998500405607529
 a sweetened boy’s breath. 1.7598827819895104
 welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy. 5.757128641948109
 vico road, dalkey. 1.184277685344238
  pyrrhus, sir? pyrrhus, a pier. 3.8205275351534542
 all laughed. 1.0
 mirthless high malicious laughter. 3.528981838644345
 armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile. 5.744250324409412
 in a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay. 4.2599746069199576
  tell me now, stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book, what is a pier. 4.460332054345989
  a pier, sir, armstrong said. 2.2027146712042187
 a thing out in the water. 1.7119400073619782
 a kind of a bridge. 1.7613128289275093
 kingstown pier, sir. 1.064214588430563
 some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. 4.139154164586735
 two in the back bench whispered. 2.6401855177669806
 they knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent. 7.60303155407579
 with envy he watched their faces: edith, ethel, gerty, lily. 4.863376994533769
 their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle. 10.988788899765273
  kingstown pier, stephen said. 1.396294882615291
 yes, a disappointed bridge. 2.9538681674792895
 the words troubled their gaze. 1.268838136441345
  how, sir? comyn asked. 2.690489504845264
 a bridge is across a river. 2.4299643962106976
 for haines’s chapbook. 2.855514341475063
 no one here to hear. 1.2607467842612214
 tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. 3.9948134187738096
 what then? a jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master’s praise. 8.216449279904825
 why had they chosen all that part? not wholly for the smooth caress. 4.508794838439233
 for them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop. 5.23501568758873
 had pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in argos or julius caesar not been knifed to death. 6.960754722583293
 they are not to be thought away. 2.6170576632654994
 time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted. 4.667151550447433
 but can those have been possible seeing that they never were? or was that only possible which came to pass? weave, weaver of the wind. 9.99266154643871
  tell us a story, sir. 1.216124618803526
  o, do, sir. 2.64500515024532
 a ghoststory. 1.0
  where do you begin in this? stephen asked, opening another book. 2.189860200538742
 — weep no more,_ comyn said. 2.468896519356763
  go on then, talbot. 2.4657957154707737
  and the story, sir?  after, stephen said. 4.5493788540565685
 go on, talbot. 1.466826983768425
 a swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel. 3.3453596574813886
 he recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text: _ weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more for lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, sunk though he be beneath the watery floor. 9.511087675571154
_ it must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible. 4.205957260013975
 aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of saint genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of paris, night by night. 10.437756864115373
 by his elbow a delicate siamese conned a handbook of strategy. 8.081898823936335
 fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. 17.808191500863227
 thought is the thought of thought. 3.1797088857026776
 tranquil brightness. 1.0
 the soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms. 6.2270214047465595
 tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms. 5.2321787511427855
 talbot repeated: _ through the dear might of him that walked the waves, through the dear might. 8.076464616759463
_  turn over, stephen said quietly. 3.4027439357979237
 i don’t see anything. 1.1170705344282095
  what, sir? talbot asked simply, bending forward. 3.908763668765682
 his hand turned the page over. 1.5417980984999002
 he leaned back and went on again, having just remembered. 3.345554121225214
 of him that walked the waves. 3.02275743452467
 here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and on mine. 13.939411260641666
 it lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute. 2.424168563095006
 to caesar what is caesar’s, to god what is god’s. 5.188588621781841
 a long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church’s looms. 7.388307020188697
 riddle me, riddle me, randy ro. 5.4348080658169176
 my father gave me seeds to sow. 1.686651070026984
 talbot slid his closed book into his satchel. 4.012119041030946
  have i heard all? stephen asked. 3.225628514745302
  yes, sir. 1.0230423539818776
 hockey at ten, sir. 1.969111569298015
  half day, sir. 1.2042655363169374
  who can answer a riddle? stephen asked. 1.9202189099655207
 they bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling. 4.013262312205868
 crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily:  a riddle, sir? ask me, sir. 9.920956865941491
  o, ask me, sir. 1.898512942212636
  a hard one, sir. 2.2683872356578307
  this is the riddle, stephen said: the cock crew, the sky was blue: the bells in heaven were striking eleven. 6.129601518035489
 ’tis time for this poor soul to go to heaven. 2.994041945023141
 what is that?  what, sir?  again, sir. 5.871951967975435
 we didn’t hear. 1.1500980859750503
 their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. 1.8291691637356258
 after a silence cochrane said:  what is it, sir? we give it up. 2.838510618639934
 stephen, his throat itching, answered:  the fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush. 6.3734907350980325
 he stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay. 4.780909856283002
 a stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:  hockey! they broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. 7.888889964651042
 quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues. 8.925336031863617
 sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook. 3.222206692526697
 his tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. 7.981837071553569
 on his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail’s bed. 10.76889326704727
 he held out his copybook. 1.203516496472773
 the word  sums was written on the headline. 4.050192702331472
 beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot. 6.127296231297365
 cyril sargent: his name and seal. 2.109213426649464
  mr deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir. 6.643337776065624
 stephen touched the edges of the book. 1.4611913145240172
  do you understand how to do them now? he asked. 3.4397229463064622
  numbers eleven to fifteen, sargent answered. 5.773383496493526
 mr deasy said i was to copy them off the board, sir. 2.924372526288319
  can you do them yourself? stephen asked. 1.7963121599519944
  no, sir. 1.079171689250229
 ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail’s bed. 8.405595611065962
 yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart. 4.272948717284332
 but for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail. 12.113332219231818
 she had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own. 2.176301974703692
 was that then real? the only true thing in life? his mother’s prostrate body the fiery columbanus in holy zeal bestrode. 9.306767124456158
 she was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. 4.199301427503529
 she had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. 7.16375529911357
 a poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped. 17.38187650097141
 sitting at his side stephen solved out the problem. 4.320304259156072
 he proves by algebra that shakespeare’s ghost is hamlet’s grandfather. 3.3356184637122195
 sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses. 1.478459699132646
 hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field. 5.205017620623803
 across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. 12.694230309552216
 give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the moors. 13.045028109177162
 gone too from the world, averroes and moses maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend. 13.862707912070409
  do you understand now? can you work the second for yourself?  yes, sir. 3.3365219869723095
 in long shaky strokes sargent copied the data. 2.3152486918217665
 waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin. 10.301732324413742
  amor matris:_ subjective and objective genitive. 7.089868274318167
 with her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands. 8.71806523417919
 like him was i, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. 11.448690970139518
 my childhood bends beside me. 1.0674901303881201
 too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly. 6.460384497182251
 mine is far and his secret as our eyes. 5.122513779033171
 secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned. 9.80546964868279
 the sum was done. 1.5827512032025364
  it is very simple, stephen said as he stood up. 2.969744232941931
  yes, sir. 1.0230423539818776
 thanks, sargent answered. 5.485732410502563
 he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench. 4.669415344383664
  you had better get your stick and go out to the others, stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form. 7.548660087735026
  yes, sir. 1.0230423539818776
 in the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield. 4.056156291835842
  sargent!  run on, stephen said. 5.164121389295645
 mr deasy is calling you. 1.4426107972375648
 he stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife. 5.979411920127624
 they were sorted in teams and mr deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. 5.279025849470275
 when he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. 4.072051527115377
 he turned his angry white moustache. 1.3975183382701177
  what is it now? he cried continually without listening. 2.689267924359371
  cochrane and halliday are on the same side, sir, stephen said. 4.461805456402338
  will you wait in my study for a moment, mr deasy said, till i restore order here. 4.36644511458315
 and as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice cried sternly:  what is the matter? what is it now? their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head. 12.067072131709338
 stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs. 9.408730667178984
 as on the first day he bargained with me here. 3.247568803315725
 as it was in the beginning, is now. 3.776747151295781
 on the sideboard the tray of stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. 5.586003728958845
 and snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end. 11.870160812768503
 a hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. 3.5643548026544614
 blowing out his rare moustache mr deasy halted at the table. 3.368513212471074
  first, our little financial settlement, he said. 6.063107179167696
 he brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. 3.808237669800206
 it slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table. 6.2566408218425105
  two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away. 3.9529498361964484
 and now his strongroom for the gold. 4.0039936684431625
 stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and this, the scallop of saint james. 16.560063714789194
 an old pilgrim’s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells. 5.926307274277699
 a sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth. 7.825254315124559
  three, mr deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand. 3.3790081649470167
 these are handy things to have. 2.301749219407741
 this is for sovereigns. 1.389470904308933
 this is for shillings. 2.5347757094381707
 sixpences, halfcrowns. 1.3111834184289106
 and here crowns. 1.559525660118602
 he shot from it two crowns and two shillings. 3.389186580384794
  three twelve, he said. 2.15026378583453
 i think you’ll find that’s right. 2.116605356463303
  thank you, sir, stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers. 6.795755641687763
  no thanks at all, mr deasy said. 2.5087307378117885
 you have earned it. 1.9140081573856307
 stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. 4.282658893030048
 symbols too of beauty and of power. 6.633267441903448
 a lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery. 1.8420962984217981
  don’t carry it like that, mr deasy said. 2.1443833190814474
 you’ll pull it out somewhere and lose it. 2.8182909876896205
 you just buy one of these machines. 1.5909895286840168
 you’ll find them very handy. 1.5348065321150137
 answer something. 1.0
  mine would be often empty, stephen said. 4.539419147022782
 the same room and hour, the same wisdom: and i the same. 7.27243914000226
 three times now. 1.282450397055334
 three nooses round me here. 5.02440657922601
 well? i can break them in this instant if i will. 2.3453525383850886
  because you don’t save, mr deasy said, pointing his finger. 2.2587912205994183
 you don’t know yet what money is. 3.067801399462446
 money is power. 3.688590294105018
 when you have lived as long as i have. 3.1662061324606716
 i know, i know. 1.6437594298730158
 if youth but knew. 1.5292566223760138
 but what does shakespeare say?  put but money in thy purse. 4.312363201645305
_  iago, stephen murmured. 1.4910509818212412
 he lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare. 2.306943812454706
  he knew what money was, mr deasy said. 2.240847090859168
 he made money. 1.0409814831934008
 a poet, yes, but an englishman too. 3.36736896322006
 do you know what is the pride of the english? do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an englishman’s mouth? the seas’ ruler. 9.296510850314034
 his seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating. 7.583180085653047
  that on his empire, stephen said, the sun never sets. 4.327674536963923
  ba! mr deasy cried. 1.987092684530636
 that’s not english. 1.6536025835632073
 a french celt said that. 2.395576198690449
 he tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail. 1.744448874216426
  i will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. 3.6779421780513752
  i paid my way. 1.009977931861797
_ good man, good man. 2.313428237955313
 _ i paid my way. 1.2501417174026097
 i never borrowed a shilling in my life. 2.552694174908671
_ can you feel that?  i owe nothing. 4.285229330439351
_ can you? mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties. 7.053730969615998
 curran, ten guineas. 1.3697543279513233
 mccann, one guinea. 1.7292778472832593
 fred ryan, two shillings. 2.2920514083897956
 temple, two lunches. 2.3812105509023995
 russell, one guinea, cousins, ten shillings, bob reynolds, half a guinea, koehler, three guineas, mrs mackernan, five weeks’ board. 15.825999271020915
 the lump i have is useless. 2.3332091615435826
  for the moment, no, stephen answered. 2.462598226609192
 mr deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox. 2.0404377788431534
  i knew you couldn’t, he said joyously. 3.3690801857662716
 but one day you must feel it. 2.3525496240182
 we are a generous people but we must also be just. 5.977357227584815
  i fear those big words, stephen said, which make us so unhappy. 3.119486727366338
 mr deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: albert edward, prince of wales. 6.390800434503192
  you think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said. 6.079577727241462
 i saw three generations since o’connell’s time. 4.897888566115776
 i remember the famine in ’Number. 2.083902922568206
 do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before o’connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue? you fenians forget some things. 15.930302141454836
 glorious, pious and immortal memory. 3.503493522826592
 the lodge of diamond in armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes. 7.813036084913299
 hoarse, masked and armed, the planters’ covenant. 10.087648561031164
 the black north and true blue bible. 3.2580028756857655
 croppies lie down. 1.2491306258294206
 stephen sketched a brief gesture. 4.367994436387479
  i have rebel blood in me too, mr deasy said. 2.02694194956811
 on the spindle side. 2.4356716982171793
 but i am descended from sir john blackwood who voted for the union. 2.616242127983888
 we are all irish, all kings’ sons. 4.821775298268816
  alas, stephen said. 1.706579825326784
 — per vias  rectas, mr deasy said firmly, was his motto. 4.03791602164947
 he voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to dublin from the ards of down to do so. 9.409169788780115
 lal the ral the ra the rocky road to dublin. 3.022531650889504
 a gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. 2.3768851767869728
 soft day, sir john! soft day, your honour!. 8.317368696230448
 day!. 1.0
 day!. 1.0
 two topboots jog dangling on to dublin. 3.0512979097190294
 lal the ral the ra. 2.0876134103664428
 lal the ral the raddy. 2.3443360454439923
  that reminds me, mr deasy said. 1.2020191769200312
 you can do me a favour, mr dedalus, with some of your literary friends. 3.0798479879086527
 i have a letter here for the press. 2.001057897305606
 sit down a moment. 1.2428296682917954
 i have just to copy the end. 1.915209574458229
 he went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter. 7.177364438440584
  sit down. 1.0
 excuse me, he said over his shoulder,  the dictates of common sense. 2.876514938809773
_ just a moment. 1.4859338626657108
 he peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error. 10.609514365582125
 stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. 4.2788547268810255
 framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord hastings’  repulse, the duke of westminster’s  shotover, the duke of beaufort’s  ceylon,  prix de  paris, Number. 10.129577472667123
 elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. 4.534498052989133
 he saw their speeds, backing king’s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds. 6.2861788857023395
  full stop, mr deasy bade his keys. 1.4037867957753927
  but prompt ventilation of this allimportant question. 3.727078031397116
_ where cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush. 10.836995628216195
 even money  fair rebel. 1.510932475991783
_ ten to one the field. 4.460649676186135
 dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher’s dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange. 19.802099311946222
 shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle. 3.495203915453697
 again: a goal. 1.5352215784057464
 i am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust of life. 3.9483990634720296
 you mean that knockkneed mother’s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick? jousts. 7.540736060622822
 time shocked rebounds, shock by shock. 7.422445890330925
 jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts. 13.196937338919897
  now then, mr deasy said, rising. 2.362127317717943
 he came to the table, pinning together his sheets. 5.12000769064384
 stephen stood up. 1.0060260683558264
  i have put the matter into a nutshell, mr deasy said. 2.3771540602799592
 it’s about the foot and mouth disease. 1.863534735806679
 just look through it. 1.253643146616032
 there can be no two opinions on the matter. 1.9455298804464207
 may i trespass on your valuable space. 2.507145502061799

 you will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on irish cattle. 5.804948903660706
 and it can be cured. 1.5563772197200738
 it is cured. 1.134658982552498
 my cousin, blackwood price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in austria by cattledoctors there. 7.605763814016481

 he raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke. 3.750833552029892
  mark my words, mr dedalus, he said. 2.538763387128902
 england is in the hands of the jews. 2.698712304709854
 in all the highest places: her finance, her press. 4.850338854936752
 and they are the signs of a nation’s decay. 2.9720039646990983
 wherever they gather they eat up the nation’s vital strength. 6.054757115232195

 as sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction. 7.5898960410823655
 old england is dying. 5.72267879089271
 he stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam. 5.766496337986025
 he faced about and back again. 2.4470302819322756
  dying, he said again, if not dead by now. 5.19901770655662
 the harlot’s cry from street to street shall weave old england’s windingsheet. 6.797273933429562
 his eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted. 2.8315041131686196
  a merchant, stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?  they sinned against the light, mr deasy said gravely. 13.391309227593307
 and you can see the darkness in their eyes. 2.1422591576886103
 and that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day. 3.7043326460381314

 they swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats. 13.01944295422726
 not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. 3.34675187329995
 their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. 9.255518968850744
 vain patience to heap and hoard. 1.2624203582295408
 time surely would scatter all. 2.5857461512209152
 a hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. 3.889023939807851
 their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh. 6.093753899797683
  who has not? stephen said. 1.3467723275467416
  what do you mean? mr deasy asked. 1.3901957938695322
 he came forward a pace and stood by the table. 3.0875323839122606
 his underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly. 1.3247063623492117
 is this old wisdom? he waits to hear from me. 2.5158638336624297
  history, stephen said, is a nightmare from which i am trying to awake. 2.7536748423763315
 from the playfield the boys raised a shout. 2.791165566633288
 a whirring whistle: goal. 1.9915061052201135
 what if that nightmare gave you a back kick?  the ways of the creator are not our ways, mr deasy said. 5.8388446896035795
 all human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of god. 4.308961576254434
 stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:  that is god. 2.591832636934963
 hooray! ay! whrrwhee!  what? mr deasy asked. 5.176354023216782
  a shout in the street, stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders. 2.7268406121038455
 mr deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers. 6.67542537401952
 looking up again he set them free. 2.255427165887943
  i am happier than you are, he said. 1.9897383336180332
 we have committed many errors and many sins. 1.9069027066615594
 a woman brought sin into the world. 1.2352675196718166
 for a woman who was no better than she should be, helen, the runaway wife of menelaus, ten years the greeks made war on troy. 5.7949101427498615
 a faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, macmurrough’s wife and her leman, o’rourke, prince of breffni. 11.779511917874409
 a woman too brought parnell low. 2.9323866859651373
 many errors, many failures but not the one sin. 4.670961460821621
 i am a struggler now at the end of my days. 2.507265503223676
 but i will fight for the right till the end. 2.3113720261321578
 for ulster will fight and ulster will be right. 2.898045393481847
 stephen raised the sheets in his hand. 1.8305636965322838
  well, sir, he began. 2.6316404511761484
  i foresee, mr deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work. 4.187240087974036
 you were not born to be a teacher, i think. 2.5515799712251437
 perhaps i am wrong. 1.9840756930186523
  a learner rather, stephen said. 2.6604875725082904
 and here what will you learn more? mr deasy shook his head. 2.980081490014742
  who knows? he said. 1.7193338022994689
 to learn one must be humble. 1.6080689522621159
 but life is the great teacher. 2.811633867051665
 stephen rustled the sheets again. 1.3317951648988742
  as regards these, he began. 6.895958611981611
  yes, mr deasy said. 1.1547421786025178
 you have two copies there. 2.9297070867271575
 if you can have them published at once. 1.5303762270756742

 i know two editors slightly. 3.9649550931384034
  that will do, mr deasy said briskly. 1.6836420957771443
 i wrote last night to mr field, m. 2.3912637048141483
 there is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the city arms hotel. 4.328516123943909
 i asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. 3.264788569540194
 you see if you can get it into your two papers. 2.003221815992043
 what are they? _ the evening telegraph. 2.188994770219233
_  that will do, mr deasy said. 1.92906392953319
 there is no time to lose. 1.6830952285153973
 now i have to answer that letter from my cousin. 2.585280849812808
  good morning, sir, stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket. 3.7440799544010286
 thank you. 1.0
  not at all, mr deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. 3.2947689412387247
 i like to break a lance with you, old as i am. 3.985921183196995
  good morning, sir, stephen said again, bowing to his bent back. 6.733662980136114
 he went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield. 6.207385201058105
 the lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors. 3.3313650956336325
 still i will help him in his fight. 1.764765726514912
 mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard. 3.7377781230262563

 no more letters, i hope. 1.5558000293269048
  just one moment. 1.1256246673426111
  yes, sir, stephen said, turning back at the gate. 2.5263507765827495
 mr deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath. 3.2327165496291896
  i just wanted to say, he said. 1.968016640698726
 ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews. 5.019514163105397
 do you know that? no. 1.327459735787095
 and do you know why? he frowned sternly on the bright air. 1.9654655135351013
  why, sir? stephen asked, beginning to smile. 2.978520412438293
  because she never let them in, mr deasy said solemnly. 2.8732580998176083
 a coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm. 4.12106701711393
 he turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air. 4.1556087507014094
  she never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. 7.279697606978754
 that’s why. 1.0
 on his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins. 5.1714916980276175

 shut your eyes and see. 1.5887330409514178
 stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells. 2.9275436227649423

 their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all sides. 5.957230332710454
 looking for something lost in a past life. 3.7490777962995145
 suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull. 5.35501134573829
 the man’s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. 2.531208630141125
 he turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. 6.805619046839036

 at the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears. 5.064337165875162
 his snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse. 3.3239828422959965
 they serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves. 16.261126503659536
 they waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out. 7.889925381600431
 the dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning. 11.981411757653802
 unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting from his jaws. 5.5664205434037495
 his speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf’s gallop. 5.159329847058314
 the carcass lay on his path. 1.4962652853717555
 he stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog’s bedraggled fell. 14.255823701221013

  tatters! out of that, you mongrel! the cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. 13.388836509380086
 he slunk back in a curve. 2.5481309377787955
 doesn’t see me. 1.1806076685691511
 along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it. 9.480629048994764
 he trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock. 5.110836540855504
 the simple pleasures of the poor. 1.5092628201574263
 his hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved. 6.151430872268938
 something he buried there, his grandmother. 3.994097597532039
 he rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead. 17.564129531365214

 just how she stalks over my writingtable. 3.504400185206259
 scratch my head. 1.023062404288226
 mr bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. 7.671296737792507
 clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes. 7.241308975569233
 he bent down to her, his hands on his knees. 3.578936024449238
  milk for the pussens, he said. 2.8000641545750473
  mrkgnao! the cat cried. 1.574670194498962
 they call them stupid. 1.0086093673920482
 they understand what we say better than we understand them. 3.5528367953969244
 she understands all she wants to. 1.7596549044070526
 vindictive too. 1.0
 her nature. 1.0
 curious mice never squeal. 1.4270601143570092
 seem to like it. 2.3891052206378056

 height of a tower? no, she can jump me. 2.780900841701349
  afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. 5.248829788023182
 afraid of the chookchooks. 1.042203474194141
 i never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens. 2.4368319808573804
  mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly. 1.6203121252906962
 she blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. 12.227199817531833
 he watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. 5.758235660382895
 then he went to the dresser, took the jug hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor. 11.839361462058623
  gurrhr! she cried, running to lap. 2.6907801873065447
 he watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly. 5.662879063164259
 wonder is it true if you clip them they can’t mouse after. 4.237291384753568
 why? they shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. 2.6476137168455334
 or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps. 2.488539970980793
 he listened to her licking lap. 1.787117599428867
 ham and eggs, no. 2.39350613779004
 no good eggs with this drouth. 1.956412599798214

 thursday: not a good day either for a mutton kidney at buckley’s. 3.5409144266391395
 fried with butter, a shake of pepper. 2.5069908384288953
 better a pork kidney at dlugacz’s. 2.630493169333606
 while the kettle is boiling. 2.69113439485703
 she lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean. 1.8098467283355697
 why are their tongues so rough? to lap better, all porous holes. 5.960756918699386
 nothing she can eat? he glanced round him. 1.9922959781553728
 on quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door. 5.400228529323914
 she might like something tasty. 2.0187639415733174
 thin bread and butter she likes in the morning. 2.331652096649904
 still perhaps: once in a way. 2.1328614584562975
 he said softly in the bare hall:  i’m going round the corner. 2.571199296413527
 be back in a minute. 1.7135177233362295
 and when he had heard his voice say it he added:  you don’t want anything for breakfast? a sleepy soft grunt answered:  mn. 7.343950420898102
 she didn’t want anything. 1.0472966860363924
 he heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled. 9.281242615362647
 must get those settled really. 1.5360470709299716
 all the way from gibraltar. 3.157954652852855

 i rose from the ranks, sir, and i’m proud of it. 4.518398713597285
 still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. 2.2353222905864834
 now that was farseeing. 2.434247802847825
 his hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof. 5.172178245502476
 stamps: stickyback pictures. 3.202654692866894

 the sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: plasto’s high grade ha. 4.004067061317699

 looked shut. 1.0
 all right till i come back anyhow. 2.0292560041316356
 he crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive. 6.361910749259466
 the sun was nearing the steeple of george’s church. 1.972460265704294

 a cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. 1.3801328123986385
 no, not like that. 1.5347983409210708
 a barren land, bare waste. 3.465168118591666
 vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. 5.6380909628534095
 no wind could lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. 4.028330125042517
 brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: sodom, gomorrah, edom. 6.897502476693939

 a dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. 4.625251304418802

 it bore the oldest, the first race. 2.7579162363097436
 a bent hag crossed from cassidy’s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck. 4.264865936319838
 the oldest people. 1.2819319875254853
 wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere. 8.304588461039828
 it lay there now. 1.294780477718811
 now it could bear no more. 1.9026535383611098
 dead: an old woman’s: the grey sunken cunt of the world. 4.6489610304980795
 grey horror seared his flesh. 4.012686690929236
 folding the page into his pocket he turned into eccles street, hurrying homeward. 5.044358110444744
 cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. 15.360540861726921
 well, i am here now. 2.3533464329587286
 yes, i am here now. 1.9834136295558624
 morning mouth bad images. 2.6806239828438434
 got up wrong side of the bed. 1.7014368565635587
 must begin again those sandow’s exercises. 2.4365997016805996

 yes, yes. 1.5349272879649936
 quick warm sunlight came running from berkeley road, swiftly, in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath. 9.933838758606614
 runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind. 5.741695707450096
 two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. 2.3542610709750527
 he stooped and gathered them. 1.4588803480092558
 mrs marion bloom. 1.0358738186288026
 his quickened heart slowed at once. 3.6003157954044576
 bold hand. 1.0
 mrs marion. 1.0
  poldy! entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head. 6.136893414476886
  who are the letters for? he looked at them. 2.969260012335193
  a letter for me from milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. 6.136784502559882
 and a letter for you. 2.316833487259132
 he laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees. 6.338899407030453
  do you want the blind up? letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow. 13.088631673895794
  that do? he asked, turning. 2.1001807914264767
 she was reading the card, propped on her elbow. 2.1875598291515885
  she got the things, she said. 2.1664261940623
 he waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh. 3.390456636746473
  hurry up with that tea, she said. 3.091871120563261
 i’m parched. 1.0
  the kettle is boiling, he said. 2.8749725946960916
 but he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed. 10.619067032395014
 as he went down the kitchen stairs she called:  poldy!  what?  scald the teapot. 4.224167088181244
 on the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. 3.4272315108968248
 he scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in. 15.469448329513984
 having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt. 9.56055908018953
 while he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him. 3.7337501019576824
 give her too much meat she won’t mouse. 2.4370385069032023
 say they won’t eat pork. 1.1395886535906057
 he let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. 7.506907130614717
 he sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup. 6.741894270666425
 then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. 4.607106409634068
 thanks: new tam: mr coghlan: lough owel picnic: young student: blazes boylan’s seaside girls. 8.97581464370442
 the tea was drawn. 1.220202398139718
 he filled his own moustachecup, sham crown derby, smiling. 3.2889328675551304
 silly milly’s birthday gift. 1.250537304415557
 only five she was then. 2.2724666342297817
 no, wait: four. 2.666072229159852
 i gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. 3.3772730877949813
 putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her. 3.418043150135843
 he smiled, pouring. 1.057357701878909
 o, milly bloom, you are my darling. 3.715296232686975
 you are my lookingglass from night to morning. 2.202187913016711
 i’d rather have you without a farthing than katey keogh with her ass and garden. 3.1825657638881863
 poor old professor goodwin. 1.484327792522293
 dreadful old case. 1.1972111856465528
 still he was a courteous old chap. 1.6686901564652963
 oldfashioned way he used to bow molly off the platform. 5.5809723243291485
 and the little mirror in his silk hat. 2.5780223850903803
 the night milly brought it into the parlour. 2.1226608344384954
 o, look what i found in professor goodwin’s hat! all we laughed. 4.034101775280621
 sex breaking out even then. 3.7972136219845156
 pert little piece she was. 1.8903994812438205
 he prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray. 6.167084305786692
 its hump bumped as he took it up. 3.1560589058108146
 everything on it? bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. 5.147053453457698
 he carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle. 3.023534172710754
 nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead. 7.106144090213396
  what a time you were! she said. 4.941072617149618
 she set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow. 3.5432966982904244
 he looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder. 5.658054172802738
 the warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured. 8.150795492786454
 a strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. 2.971813858025639
 in the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread. 4.717925948777925
  who was the letter from? he asked. 4.432397342632994
 bold hand. 1.0
  o, boylan, she said. 2.278333595154584
 he’s bringing the programme. 1.0306484922495571
  what are you singing? — là ci  darem with j. 2.4547607463543
 doyle, she said, and  love’s old sweet  song. 2.123202799916669
 her full lips, drinking, smiled. 2.9975407824749123
 rather stale smell that incense leaves next day. 3.425439898768025
 like foul flowerwater. 1.0700664855484345
  would you like the window open a little? she doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:  what time is the funeral?  eleven, i think, he answered. 7.337590967693742
 i didn’t see the paper. 1.1512634200454084
 following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed. 3.5473845363332384
 no? then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole. 4.262227463264784
  no: that book. 2.3559161962548596
 other stocking. 1.0
 her petticoat. 1.0
  it must have fell down, she said. 2.6791874901970987
 he felt here and there. 1.6913209751760878
  voglio e non  vorrei. 1.0388191238612259
 wonder if she pronounces that right:  voglio. 2.9948413100629305
 not in the bed. 1.2609585771881753
 must have slid down. 1.1215988870882767
 he stooped and lifted the valance. 2.218925517669491
 the book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot. 5.738235413976356
  show here, she said. 1.7429383937261385
 i put a mark in it. 2.0681255150313205
 there’s a word i wanted to ask you. 1.3578299305509114
 she swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word. 8.151391089466484
  met him what? he asked. 1.9638635337991244
  here, she said. 1.7338688048947366
 what does that mean? he leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail. 2.306114613192213
  metempsychosis?  yes. 1.316672347504728
 who’s he when he’s at home?  metempsychosis, he said, frowning. 4.5832966028370485
 it’s greek: from the greek. 1.6837381546021164
 that means the transmigration of souls. 1.5318427812367126
  o, rocks! she said. 3.707164104978687
 tell us in plain words. 1.9676088887509562
 he smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. 1.5064760073934693

  did you finish it? he asked. 1.7108327158950725
  yes, she said. 1.3592323950245233
 there’s nothing smutty in it. 4.388489836637782
 is she in love with the first fellow all the time?  never read it. 4.3909130447927
 do you want another?  yes. 1.3465598835777444
 get another of paul de kock’s. 1.966291470297656
 nice name he has. 1.4763798183215793
 she poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways. 2.262981554079711
 must get that capel street library book renewed or they’ll write to kearney, my guarantor. 6.006549899308648
 reincarnation: that’s the word. 1.2380379243545154
  some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before. 5.910391905039047
 they call it reincarnation. 1.0082677150688022
 that we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet. 5.8253181305360195
 they say we have forgotten it. 1.4705501797926037
 some say they remember their past lives. 3.4429740540600964
 the sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. 4.5243273196390374
 better remind her of the word: metempsychosis. 2.390597941082021
 an example would be better. 1.6905904088315375
 an example? the  bath of the  nymph over the bed. 4.744299148755223
 given away with the easter number of  photo  bits: splendid masterpiece in art colours. 7.190191650494174

 she said it would look nice over the bed. 2.861916690717695
 naked nymphs: greece: and for instance all the people that lived then. 6.389955570080271
 he turned the pages back. 3.469050657995641
  metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient greeks called it. 7.352653399024161
 they used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance. 2.3296495869914944
 what they called nymphs, for example. 1.4524366214791513
 her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. 1.6526510959742504
 she gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils. 3.4356510788680854
  there’s a smell of burn, she said. 1.5270623840953947
 did you leave anything on the fire?  the kidney! he cried suddenly. 3.019988059982544
 he fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs. 9.986823392192017
 pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan. 2.8344447145127614
 by prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back. 11.436775230239327
 only a little burnt. 1.4734367587515589
 he tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it. 8.385154023874637
 cup of tea now. 3.197746439304813
 he sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. 2.7211877011117322
 he shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. 4.6387494992245415
 then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat. 9.285252069273591
 done to a turn. 1.9840565874787075
 a mouthful of tea. 1.509695502241502
 then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth. 7.324194684504437
 what was that about some young student and a picnic? he creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth. 10.299273589215392

 he foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. 11.566051647056728
 he saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower. 17.544216545214958

 all watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers. 4.056546889509572
 the carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past watery lane. 5.064165669897254
 mr bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat. 7.38136704610122

 the carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. 24.502781593338966
 mr dedalus fell back, saying:  was that mulligan cad with him? his  fidus  achates!  no, mr bloom said. 7.518854789283029

 mr bloom set his thigh down. 1.2601168793514432

 mr dedalus sighed resignedly. 1.0478526860011756
  after all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world. 2.921531488213983
  did tom kernan turn up? martin cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently. 2.856347525616997

  what’s wrong?  we’re stopped. 1.5546073746023759

 mr dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky. 6.36915682484129
  it’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said. 4.890170779414952
  we’re off again. 1.1280678953451189
 the carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently. 2.9991254982150313
 martin cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard. 7.240568058283979

  his singing of that simple ballad, martin, is the most trenchant rendering i ever heard in the whole course of my experience. 4.897406822782755

 a tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of elvery’s elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine. 14.393642612828998
  in all his pristine beauty, mr power said. 2.6016177393545683
 mr dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:  the devil break the hasp of your back! mr power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed gray’s statue. 13.570210251577748
  we have all been there, martin cunningham said broadly. 3.87083072371304
 his eyes met mr bloom’s eyes. 1.6689225475127216
 he caressed his beard, adding:  well, nearly all of us. 9.36929948035351
 mr bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces. 2.756225146334013
  that’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about reuben j and the son. 3.0562584462440614
  about the boatman? mr power asked. 1.4397533862299716
 isn’t it awfully good?  what is that? mr dedalus asked. 3.883334842432316
 i didn’t hear it. 1.1640118798287105
  there was a girl in the case, mr bloom began, and he determined to send him to the isle of man out of harm’s way but when they were both. 6.896067346463414
  what? mr dedalus asked. 1.121328726516796
 that confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?  yes, mr bloom said. 3.1980319207938863
 they were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown. 2.6383972907532227
  drown barabbas! mr dedalus cried. 3.8306703258285455
 i wish to christ he did! mr power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils. 3.3470647307703474
  no, mr bloom said, the son himself. 2.757362125489608
 martin cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:  reuben j and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the isle of man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the liffey. 26.646194356098633
  for god’s sake! mr dedalus exclaimed in fright. 1.2946786075325736
 is he dead?  dead! martin cunningham cried. 4.423187268701004
 not he! a boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive. 10.589506964320995
 half the town was there. 2.3277977353784336
  yes, mr bloom said. 1.4717824653286777
 but the funny part is. 1.302860555860911
  and reuben j, martin cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son’s life. 2.9771642415614283
 a stifled sigh came from under mr power’s hand. 2.3197974854679244

  ah then indeed, he said, poor little paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh. 3.5082673241401716
 many a good one he told himself. 2.1862403854094303
  the lord forgive me! mr power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers. 2.3485154160229698
 poor paddy! i little thought a week ago when i saw him last and he was in his usual health that i’d be driving after him like this. 7.703397069790609
 he’s gone from us. 1.1497991009298816

 poisoned himself? he glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal’s mausoleum. 6.808931104216003
  was he insured? mr bloom asked. 2.5838784314216205
  i believe so, mr kernan answered. 2.1507245153221435

 which end is his head? after a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light. 11.233628692604132
 the coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners. 4.729854903870266

 mr bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. 7.4058475406103135
 he fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously. 3.6935726435775176

 mr kernan assured him. 1.6682908631086835
  who is that chap behind with tom kernan? john henry menton asked. 2.67596464388229

 ned lambert glanced back. 1.0481353205857233

 she’s his wife. 1.0246320149511083
  o, to be sure, john henry menton said. 2.331706722151744
 i haven’t seen her for some time. 1.665544777133583
 she was a finelooking woman. 2.646785069513215
 i danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at mat dillon’s in roundtown. 4.301243761116154
 and a good armful she was. 2.4558727542614287
 he looked behind through the others. 1.3070192602324766
  what is he? he asked. 2.0827865004644726
 what does he do? wasn’t he in the stationery line? i fell foul of him one evening, i remember, at bowls. 9.05967142887237

  yes, he was, he said, in wisdom hely’s. 4.111613849268566
 a traveller for blottingpaper. 1.1658526238274682
  in god’s name, john henry menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for? she had plenty of game in her then. 6.8160113867734164

 john henry menton’s large eyes stared ahead. 1.672747246788842
 the barrow turned into a side lane. 1.5687074929782716
 a portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage. 5.105499435322146

 mr dedalus said:  i am come to pay you another visit. 3.039524249463814
  my dear simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. 2.976575670070731
 i don’t want your custom at all. 1.3839984351247763
 saluting ned lambert and john henry menton he walked on at martin cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back. 7.280916539771492
  did you hear that one, he asked them, about mulcahy from the coombe?  i did not, martin cunningham said. 5.367176123752727
 they bent their silk hats in concert and hynes inclined his ear. 2.8554515148989084
 the caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles. 4.211368349446893
  they tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. 7.8263574143743835
 they asked for mulcahy from the coombe and were told where he was buried. 4.727767255141074
 after traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. 6.21588773848405
 one of the drunks spelt out the name: terence mulcahy. 3.7607437128957915
 the other drunk was blinking up at a statue of our saviour the widow had got put up. 3.682531456216983
 the caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. 2.851930652775337
 he resumed:  and, after blinking up at the sacred figure,  not a bloody bit like the  man, says he. 6.965691213455672
  that’s not  mulcahy, says he,  whoever done  it. 2.097838715872128
 rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with corny kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked. 7.23245116510507
  that’s all done with a purpose, martin cunningham explained to hynes. 2.3923114986843923

 mr dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at ned lambert’s quizzing face, asked of it sourly:  agonising christ, wouldn’t it give you a heartburn on your arse? ned lambert, seated on the table, read on: — or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way, tho’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling waters of neptune’s blue domain, ’mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’neath the shadows cast o’er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the  forest. 37.96004603218421

 i must get a drink after that. 2.1266294582437917
  drink! the editor cried. 1.3697707756413597
 no drinks served before mass. 3.072295904238265
  quite right too, mr dedalus said, going out. 3.175609480294035
 come on, ned. 1.4439203729174899
 ned lambert sidled down from the table. 2.566461218452843
 the editor’s blue eyes roved towards mr bloom’s face, shadowed by a smile. 4.647463082670234
  will you join us, myles? ned lambert asked. 3.6164849372191
 memorable battles recalled  north cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. 5.849198655466682
 we won every time! north cork and spanish officers!  where was that, myles? ned lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps. 5.910253403974628
  in ohio! the editor shouted. 1.4690982318648855
  so it was, begad, ned lambert agreed. 6.02614549999853
 passing out he whispered to j. 2.2488144426729444
 o’molloy:  incipient jigs. 1.4941182741898722
 sad case. 1.0
  ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face. 5.5761875999152215
 my ohio!  a perfect cretic! the professor said. 1.8444174818376506
 long, short and long. 10.056861595389622
 o, harp eolian! he took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth. 12.450849677936889
  bingbang, bangbang. 1.3111834184289106
 mr bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door. 4.2921197440214796
  just a moment, mr crawford, he said. 2.0769002732338993
 i just want to phone about an ad. 2.766272687603064
 he went in. 1.0618835302946759
  what about that leader this evening? professor machugh asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder. 3.5232119102211694
  that’ll be all right, myles crawford said more calmly. 2.166688250757888
 never you fret. 2.2054525626239454
 hello, jack. 1.0133308990687533
 that’s all right. 1.2797875443621751
  good day, myles, j. 5.692381105371085
 o’molloy said, letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file. 6.863729324101279
 is that canada swindle case on today? the telephone whirred inside. 2.4700146112845016
 no, twenty. 2.6168534952632987
 double four. 1.0
 spot the winner lenehan came out of the inner office with  sport’s tissues. 5.722047340301214
  who wants a dead cert for the gold cup? he asked. 3.3567146556049536
 sceptre with o. 1.3969482854577113
 madden up. 1.0
 he tossed the tissues on to the table. 1.6382670587770867
 screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open. 5.955622698281536
  hush, lenehan said. 3.407166316327471
 i hear feetstoops. 2.0866930901467335
 professor machugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps. 8.93036779852256
 the tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth. 6.481939917249068
  it wasn’t me, sir. 1.2226191205714938
 it was the big fellow shoved me, sir. 1.485055646124817
  throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. 3.5784645734462472
 there’s a hurricane blowing. 2.296236775741172
 lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice. 4.2023268504195315
  waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. 3.6237273357186646
 it was pat farrell shoved me, sir. 1.9970331267091783
 he pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe. 3.1324020824477796
  him, sir. 1.0529125494417348
  out of this with you, professor machugh said gruffly. 4.681380756823041
 he hustled the boy out and banged the door to. 9.248584770053801
 o’molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:  continued on page six, column four. 12.572597420992917
  yes,  evening  telegraph here, mr bloom phoned from the inner office. 3.3557450239336513
 is the boss. 1.0741992746518392
? yes,  telegraph. 1.4436641088790718
 to where? aha! which auction rooms?. 3.603224525319171
 aha! i see. 1.0477269077719682
 i’ll catch him. 1.0518765962942578
 a collision ensues the bell whirred again as he rang off. 7.552965289589207
 he came in quickly and bumped against lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue. 3.827208378795827
 — pardon,  monsieur, lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace. 3.257090783179593
  my fault, mr bloom said, suffering his grip. 2.5789946458760022
 are you hurt? i’m in a hurry. 1.3647514877549098
  knee, lenehan said. 7.9905625650637155
 he made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:  the accumulation of the  anno  domini. 6.379806997419607
  sorry, mr bloom said. 3.1506078575043195
 he went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. 5.655054994967787
 o’molloy slapped the heavy pages over. 1.5535534562176925
 the noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps: we are the boys of wexford who fought with heart and hand. 10.088414721855438
 exit bloom  i’m just running round to bachelor’s walk, mr bloom said, about this ad of keyes’s. 4.850392744331378
 want to fix it up. 2.554082076766046
 they tell me he’s round there in dillon’s. 1.8494640312966806
 he looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. 3.453287603752106
 the editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply. 5.09441142736199
  begone! he said. 1.3713573228202673
 the world is before you. 1.146804142576335
  back in no time, mr bloom said, hurrying out. 3.335937466983624
 o’molloy took the tissues from lenehan’s hand and read them, blowing them apart gently, without comment. 6.6956001438614905
  he’ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. 3.5081022041013274
 look at the young scamps after him. 2.890872481369773
 where? lenehan cried, running to the window. 1.9722581240389478
 a street cortège both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in mr bloom’s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots. 17.6305202169896
  look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, lenehan said, and you’ll kick. 4.526944663968002
 o, my rib risible! taking off his flat spaugs and the walk. 6.109997412444236
 small nines. 1.0
 steal upon larks. 1.8282976717501371
 he began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to j. 6.820968537287695
 o’molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands. 2.9305735562766473
  what’s that? myles crawford said with a start. 1.5420371774251223
 where are the other two gone?  who? the professor said, turning. 4.715180129424843
 they’re gone round to the oval for a drink. 2.07553469300748
 paddy hooper is there with jack hall. 2.1048045485771993
 came over last night. 1.6451219690964476
  come on then, myles crawford said. 2.6200907787678855
 where’s my hat? he walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket. 8.517622183477062
 they jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer. 3.1964112741929416
  he’s pretty well on, professor machugh said in a low voice. 3.669011636779356
  seems to be, j. 2.4294147319148185
 o’molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. 6.402553118505226
 who has the most matches? the calumet of peace he offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. 5.604850195346771
 lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. 3.3803931894729486
 o’molloy opened his case again and offered it. 2.405668156283419
 — thanky  vous, lenehan said, helping himself. 4.316459728254107
 the editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. 1.9083897088607755
 he declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor machugh: ’twas rank and fame that tempted thee, ’twas empire charmed thy heart. 5.3334520188720065
 the professor grinned, locking his long lips. 4.3074284345912135
  eh? you bloody old roman empire? myles crawford said. 2.472575476477843
 he took a cigarette from the open case. 1.5085493837851212
 lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said:  silence for my brandnew riddle! — imperium  romanum, j. 7.771167694520769
 o’molloy said gently. 1.2226814343980494
 it sounds nobler than british or brixton. 2.5148520835584915
 the word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire. 2.6687744788253154
 myles crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling. 1.822879571428319
  that’s it, he said. 1.769524158795173
 we are the fat. 1.079308861571706
 you and i are the fat in the fire. 3.8313877197792063
 we haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell. 3.325105945924609
 the grandeur that was rome  wait a moment, professor machugh said, raising two quiet claws. 4.249434413790322
 we mustn’t be led away by words, by sounds of words. 3.2528222451152757
 we think of rome, imperial, imperious, imperative. 2.8456520279380078
 he extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:  what was their civilisation? vast, i allow: but vile. 11.992857462883485
 cloacae: sewers. 1.5222847672820157
 the jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said:  it is meet to be here. 4.988833985105275
 let us build an altar to  jehovah. 1.551808694248084
 the roman, like the englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. 16.361946529601127
 he gazed about him in his toga and he said:  it is meet to be here. 3.6736523590007826
 let us construct a watercloset. 4.4049539873889625
_  which they accordingly did do, lenehan said. 8.508266061507603
 our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of guinness’s, were partial to the running stream. 8.169370622699034
  they were nature’s gentlemen, j. 1.3325961892904625
 o’molloy murmured. 1.0

 o’molloy asked. 1.0
 it was at the royal university dinner. 1.9342382207923874
 everything was going swimmingly . 3.0320428904384413
  first my riddle, lenehan said. 4.488981551717665
 are you ready? mr o’madden burke, tall in copious grey of donegal tweed, came in from the hallway. 5.8595443408694585
 stephen dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered. 2.8793730379286098
 — entrez, mes enfants!_ lenehan cried. 4.039748585440931
  i escort a suppliant, mr o’madden burke said melodiously. 4.491333284638652
 youth led by experience visits notoriety. 2.7970011636986367
  how do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. 1.8727288621269493

 ??? lenehan said to all:  silence! what opera resembles a railwayline? reflect, ponder, excogitate, reply. 14.360904690770823
 stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature. 3.683361535481727
  who? the editor asked. 1.2148424430386724
 bit torn off. 2.737883956733417
  mr garrett deasy, stephen said. 19.17177598976387
  that old pelters, the editor said. 3.25015185612816
 who tore it? was he short taken? on swift sail flaming from storm and south he comes, pale vampire, mouth to my mouth. 8.609027253834066
  good day, stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their shoulders. 5.087316026116745
 foot and mouth? are you turned. 7.521100677161779
? bullockbefriending bard. 1.0007812443133108

 the letter is not mine. 1.7108489851053408
 mr garrett deasy asked me to. 10.731700481872537
  o, i know him, myles crawford said, and i knew his wife too. 3.078535049180878
 the bloodiest old tartar god ever made. 8.75831140346519

 o’molloy said quietly, turning a horseshoe paperweight. 4.087206266665821
 saving princes is a thank you job. 2.5288389514422907
 professor machugh turned on him. 1.168409841709669
  and if not? he said. 2.754251661132566
  i’ll tell you how it was, myles crawford began. 2.979402230144833
 a hungarian it was one day. 1.9743768717627095
 lost causes noble marquess mentioned  we were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. 4.967569623737632
 success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. 5.0939608784838155
 we were never loyal to the successful. 1.6470793935576864
 we serve them. 1.0020225233877293
 i teach the blatant latin language. 1.279687605286646

  boohoo! lenehan wept with a little noise. 2.285683703810377
 owing to a brick received in the latter half of the  matinée. 3.83895140275207
 poor, poor, poor pyrrhus! he whispered then near stephen’s ear: lenehan’s limerick — there’s a ponderous pundit machugh who wears goggles of ebony hue. 6.965583754383069
 as he mostly sees double to wear them why trouble? i can’t see the joe miller. 9.582769645216631

 i’ll read the rest after. 1.3749683597320645
 that’ll be all right. 1.1849530457630015
 lenehan extended his hands in protest. 3.4901178753580546
  but my riddle! he said. 1.5045625667551012
 what opera is like a railwayline?  opera? mr o’madden burke’s sphinx face reriddled. 7.389167420706402
 lenehan announced gladly: — the rose of  castile. 2.7835931797107203
 see the wheeze? rows of cast steel. 4.101974989993951
 gee! he poked mr o’madden burke mildly in the spleen. 2.71592950190489
 mr o’madden burke fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp. 3.7439739859243466
  help! he sighed. 1.097082523320268
 i feel a strong weakness. 1.7449409691049595
 lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues. 6.718647402827616
 the professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across stephen’s and mr o’madden burke’s loose ties. 8.08494438006121

 “you can do it!” the editor laid a nervous hand on stephen’s shoulder. 2.889049695498662

 you don’t say so? a friend of my father’s, is it?  never mind gumley, myles crawford cried angrily. 4.240424755178596

 out of an advertisement. 1.1340659427164
 gregor grey made the design for it. 3.1815876844307955

 yes, he’s here still. 1.8368839051732042
 come across yourself. 1.163461284063643
  where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried. 3.478038376010833
 he flung the pages down. 1.4973081986246413
  clamn dever, lenehan said to mr o’madden burke. 3.2972536635521426
  very smart, mr o’madden burke said. 1.7876422530440732
 professor machugh came from the inner office. 1.0913096804561646
  talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder. 5.049866448557431
  o yes, j. 1.2784548906971316
 o’molloy said eagerly. 1.07607233339209
 lady dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she’d buy a view of dublin. 6.857519259597635
 and it turned out to be a commemoration postcard of joe brady or number one or skin thegoat. 4.436048662659914
 right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!  they’re only in the hook and eye department, myles crawford said. 10.080119459212481
 psha! press and the bar! where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows, like whiteside, like isaac butt, like silvertongued o’hagan. 13.72670301529612
 eh? ah, bloody nonsense. 1.5171107268962647
 psha! only in the halfpenny place. 3.2073742163305523
 his mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain. 4.225264873381231
 would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? how do you know? why did you write it then? rhymes and reasons mouth, south. 8.449570947723405
 is the mouth south someway? or the south a mouth? must be some. 4.989570041370365
 south, pout, out, shout, drouth. 7.5158461085537445
 rhymes: two men dressed the same, looking the same, two by two. 7.287828889266528

 he saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in russet, entwining,  per l’aer  perso, in mauve, in purple,  quella pacifica  oriafiamma, gold of oriflamme,  di rimirar fè più ardenti. 28.609537363593894
_ but i old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth south: tomb womb. 9.775548392680683
  speak up for yourself, mr o’madden burke said. 1.8598165315614201
 sufficient for the day. 2.447263142171295
 o’molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage. 5.688770232067907
  my dear myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false construction on my words. 6.4478802849544765
 i hold no brief, as at present advised, for the third profession  qua profession but your cork legs are running away with you. 6.506585235106003
 why not bring in henry grattan and flood and demosthenes and edmund burke? ignatius gallaher we all know and his chapelizod boss, harmsworth of the farthing press, and his american cousin of the bowery guttersheet not to mention  paddy kelly’s  budget,  pue’s  occurrences and our watchful friend  the skibbereen  eagle. 15.374002909331839
 why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like whiteside? sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof. 9.724194013615808
 links with bygone days of yore  grattan and flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his face. 6.433162902101937

 o’molloy said, bushe k. 5.723360159433557
, for example. 1.1533928563304288
  bushe? the editor said. 1.3225332803409988
 well, yes: bushe, yes. 9.959607749284855
 he has a strain of it in his blood. 1.9740059306421474
 kendal bushe or i mean seymour bushe. 5.534368453328383
  he would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for . 3.251018989111347
 but no matter. 1.100967427681175
 o’molloy turned to stephen and said quietly and slowly:  one of the most polished periods i think i ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of seymour bushe. 7.952715351947251
 it was in that case of fratricide, the childs murder case. 6.237614260648397
 bushe defended him. 2.170589304221112
  and in the porches of mine ear did pour. 2.69333467122519
_ by the way how did he find that out? he died in his sleep. 5.819238358874924
 or the other story, beast with two backs?  what was that? the professor asked. 5.307717684427378
 italia, magistra artium  he spoke on the law of evidence, j. 6.277322276354262
 o’molloy said, of roman justice as contrasted with the earlier mosaic code, the  lex  talionis. 15.43556068199964
 and he cited the moses of michelangelo in the vatican. 5.1989183774519505
  a few wellchosen words, lenehan prefaced. 4.76550783448175
 silence! pause. 1.452129766879567
 o’molloy took out his cigarettecase. 1.250557234051698
 false lull. 1.0
 something quite ordinary. 1.1268671967914676
 messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar. 2.813970667022715
 i have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives. 10.070668576059154
 a polished period j. 1.4620829392345247
 o’molloy resumed, moulding his words:  he said of it:  that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to live. 25.579091685306835
_ his slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall. 3.172864633230588
  fine! myles crawford said at once. 1.9591681106530823
  the divine afflatus, mr o’madden burke said. 2.295525804738694
  you like it? j. 1.3222765721778016
 o’molloy asked stephen. 1.1836202003994205
 stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. 3.601417519777089
 he took a cigarette from the case. 1.2715639991181464
 o’molloy offered his case to myles crawford. 2.009555801975123
 lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying:  muchibus thankibus. 5.270625976404449
 a man of high morale  professor magennis was speaking to me about you, j. 4.96373788941815
 o’molloy said to stephen. 1.5084472225363872
 what do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: a. 5.534295940818058
 the mastermystic? that blavatsky woman started it. 9.076996007691603
 she was a nice old bag of tricks. 1.706176686036034
 has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness. 6.262120790419211
 magennis thinks you must have been pulling a. 1.6946466385700711
’s leg. 1.0
 he is a man of the very highest morale, magennis. 3.0482995050193344
 speaking about me. 2.5451472307688037
 what did he say? what did he say? what did he say about me? don’t ask. 6.8256884527430834
  no, thanks, professor machugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside. 3.3275860752264825
 wait a moment. 1.0195998369639423
 let me say one thing. 2.0976683821382776
 the finest display of oratory i ever heard was a speech made by john f taylor at the college historical society. 9.99334551191873
 mr justice fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the irish tongue. 15.465561813517205
 he turned towards myles crawford and said:  you know gerald fitzgibbon. 2.136078244695231
 then you can imagine the style of his discourse. 1.8660929558679453
  he is sitting with tim healy, j. 1.9679853575592152
 o’molloy said, rumour has it, on the trinity college estates commission. 6.08749464244418
  he is sitting with a sweet thing, myles crawford said, in a child’s frock. 3.9522853570319403
 go on. 1.0
 well?  it was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction i will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the new movement. 14.14958229455378
 it was then a new movement. 2.020020396184983
 we were weak, therefore worthless. 2.1741829270823847
 he closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus. 18.447927541056874
 impromptu in ferial tone he addressed j. 2.2449653363394186
 o’molloy:  taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. 4.161534860507095
 that he had prepared his speech i do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall. 5.7617044604434575
 his dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it. 4.079997712815122
 he wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man. 7.414982299324402
 his gaze turned at once but slowly from j. 3.063113481143432
 o’molloy’s towards stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. 3.463001376073047
 his unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair. 6.5291896572201
 still seeking, he said:  when fitzgibbon’s speech had ended john f taylor rose to reply. 4.312428245160944
 briefly, as well as i can bring them to mind, his words were these. 6.107567760772397
 he raised his head firmly. 1.0616703828297958
 his eyes bethought themselves once more. 2.2090930228382244
 witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet. 7.311449727164709
 he began: _ mr chairman, ladies and gentlemen: great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of ireland a moment since by my learned friend. 6.633322591591608
 it seemed to me that i had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that i stood in ancient egypt and that i was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful moses. 10.41897093978767
_ his listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. 6.532406972922717
  and let our crooked smokes. 1.6776976696466634
_ noble words coming. 1.9796504090364633
 look out. 1.0
 could you try your hand at it yourself? _ and it seemed to me that i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. 8.873781983635496
 i heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me. 2.5244245945319466
_ from the fathers it was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted. 13.684157284539523
 ah, curse you! that’s saint augustine. 3.3699523953790123
 _ why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language? you are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people. 8.389128351605795
 you have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe. 16.771566419171332
 you have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a polity. 11.70609906940053
_ nile. 1.0
 child, man, effigy. 3.4604433692177503
 by the nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone. 12.359641351708412
 _ you pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of isis and osiris, of horus and ammon ra. 15.190290306144188
 yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. 4.806679834704089
 israel is weak and few are her children: egypt is an host and terrible are her arms. 5.989379713164543
 vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our name. 7.458631879655577
_ a dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. 5.778573208060813
 he lifted his voice above it boldly: _ but, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day. 17.74507693955741
 he would never have spoken with the eternal amid lightnings on sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw. 12.437651406814338

 it is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is shakespeare who has studied  hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre. 15.836005114914885

 is it possible that that player shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son’s name (had hamnet shakespeare lived he would have been prince hamlet’s twin), is it possible, i want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: i am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, ann shakespeare, born hathaway?  but this prying into the family life of a great man, russell began impatiently. 28.75959331440994

 he creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:  is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet? alarmed face asks me. 18.23018534292635

  as we, or mother dana, weave and unweave our bodies, stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image. 16.579734723360964
 and as the mole on my right breast is where it was when i was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth. 15.734695940054921

  i hope mr dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public. 3.364102034327708
 and we ought to mention another irish commentator, mr george bernard shaw. 2.3896611826503595
 nor should we forget mr frank harris. 1.6805694007421346
 his articles on shakespeare in the  saturday  review were surely brilliant. 3.992026100634894
 oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets. 4.23134691722737

 why does he send to one who is a  buonaroba,_ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? he was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written  romeo and  juliet. 15.517355408719208
 why? belief in himself has been untimely killed. 6.526689438163886
 he was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, i should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down. 13.268661844926907

 but those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come. 8.16109876169934
 the poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it king hamlet’s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator. 7.9240675842471155

 mr mulligan, i’ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of shakespeare. 8.39030629827361
 all sides of life should be represented. 1.9886198719110322

 i seem to know the name. 1.398373098381159
 a flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features. 2.271512931112143

  the most brilliant of all is that story of wilde’s, mr best said, lifting his brilliant notebook. 3.236232301208045

 or hughie wills? mr william himself. 1.8957130557085173
: who am i?  i mean, for willie hughes, mr best said, amending his gloss easily. 4.795535082303905
 of course it’s all paradox, don’t you know, hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it’s so typical the way he works it out. 7.447760401134493
 it’s the very essence of wilde, don’t you know. 1.5961019607618951
 the light touch. 1.8122986375599814

 maybe, like socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife. 6.267979055011866
 but she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. 5.375705244242769
 two deeds are rank in that ghost’s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband’s brother. 7.735492961297526
 sweet ann, i take it, was hot in the blood. 4.224540320716564

  the burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. 4.99343307534358
 if you deny that in the fifth scene of  hamlet he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him. 10.301521269353598
 all those women saw their men down and under: mary, her goodman john, ann, her poor dear willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, joan, her four brothers, judith, her husband and all her sons, susan, her husband too, while susan’s daughter, elizabeth, to use granddaddy’s words, wed her second, having killed her first. 38.7166869234403
 o, yes, mention there is. 6.226419971810363

 woa!  pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, john eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type. 7.992772113672388
  he was a rich country gentleman, stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at stratford and a house in ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. 9.481413538865565
 why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?  it is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, mr secondbest best said finely. 10.679225739642188

  antiquity mentions famous beds, second eglinton puckered, bedsmiling. 4.835420679441444

  antiquity mentions that stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don’t forget nell gwynn herpyllis) and let her live in his villa. 22.676131069803446

 you cannot eat your cake and have it. 3.5262133587533038
 sayest thou so? will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?  and the sense of property, stephen said. 6.942059560206642

 the son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots. 11.709257507540773
 his borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by chettle falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing. 5.027727255043544
 he sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent. 8.580048873659807
 how else could aubrey’s ostler and callboy get rich quick? all events brought grist to his mill. 7.243428139535542
 shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen’s leech lopez, his jew’s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive:  hamlet and  macbeth with the coming to the throne of a scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting. 22.54750963366936

  saint thomas, stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works i enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new viennese school mr magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. 21.748167994136477
 he means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. 16.97798809048135
 jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage. 14.018560651999914
 accusations are made in anger. 1.2213577852106137
 the christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel. 12.531490036928608

  she lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes. 15.235785340330626
 in old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed with her at new place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul. 12.821705193488594

 if you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, with thirtyfive years of life,  nel mezzo del cammin di nostra  vita, with fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. 25.441620599112756

 o, that was a very nice name to have. 2.505581128611757
 father conmee gave a letter from his breast to master brunny lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of fitzgibbon street. 4.426199543891414
  but mind you don’t post yourself into the box, little man, he said. 2.6406595772902586
 the boys sixeyed father conmee and laughed:  o, sir. 5.197650959345544
  well, let me see if you can post a letter, father conmee said. 2.9873497608131996
 master brunny lynam ran across the road and put father conmee’s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. 7.4485929375385815
 father conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along mountjoy square east. 3.3880736518430723
 mr denis j maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady maxwell at the corner of dignam’s court. 10.044862468097469
 was that not mrs m’guinness? mrs m’guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to father conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed. 8.40798312603311
 and father conmee smiled and saluted. 2.3277369679879993
 how did she do? a fine carriage she had. 3.2746202231379304

 it was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare. 3.0284979951091127

 a band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from richmond street. 2.534623792067784

 near aldborough house father conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. 5.549844398962725
 and now it was an office or something. 2.861711307867833
 father conmee began to walk along the north strand road and was saluted by mr william gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. 4.882586539537357
 father conmee saluted mr william gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. 6.77095191372701
 he passed grogan’s the tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in new york. 11.46046917729281
 in america those things were continually happening. 2.0740378175628797
 unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. 2.769774303274573
 still, an act of perfect contrition. 3.2850773071677026
 father conmee went by daniel bergin’s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged. 6.459392439342691
 they saluted him and were saluted. 5.53485063918756
 father conmee passed h. 1.5473052164932717
 o’neill’s funeral establishment where corny kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay. 3.2268981996451926
 a constable on his beat saluted father conmee and father conmee saluted the constable. 5.741223790037504
 in youkstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, father conmee observed pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes. 8.23710152995357
 moored under the trees of charleville mall father conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him. 16.060930832403656
 it was idyllic: and father conmee reflected on the providence of the creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people. 10.470318820322086
 on newcomen bridge the very reverend john conmee s. 1.4358992418814371
 of saint francis xavier’s church, upper gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram. 3.704939019716759
 off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend nicholas dudley c. 2.692239524749575
 of saint agatha’s church, north william street, on to newcomen bridge. 6.086252528358453
 at newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island. 4.926029133882533
 father conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse. 10.347957663121454
 passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. 22.069106891528158
 the solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to father conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. 4.7498787125545405
 father conmee liked cheerful decorum. 1.36907465715803
 it was a peaceful day. 1.1677543332874778
 the gentleman with the glasses opposite father conmee had finished explaining and looked down. 3.2953695181558937
 his wife, father conmee supposed. 2.9275070987811747
 a tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses. 5.098667095758819
 she raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly. 8.012961897666795
 father conmee perceived her perfume in the car. 1.9770671209579826
 he perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat. 7.174666938801898
 father conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head. 8.269706445183274
 at annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. 6.378514771643575
 the conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her. 3.9084514600025413
 she passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and father conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and father conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice  bless you, my child,_ that they have been absolved,  pray for me. 15.630843168274131
_ but they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures. 4.271560772473902
 from the hoardings mr eugene stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at father conmee. 4.211527914858572
 father conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint peter claver s. 6.720662866990783
 and the african mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night. 12.13468651747698
 that book by the belgian jesuit,  le nombre des élus,_ seemed to father conmee a reasonable plea. 8.116665123901983
 those were millions of human souls created by god in his own likeness to whom the faith had not (d. 3.3099190895391684
) been brought. 2.4051384206035724
 but they were god’s souls, created by god. 2.639076699622357
 it seemed to father conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say. 7.706869439712414
 at the howth road stop father conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn. 7.975929728538122
 the malahide road was quiet. 1.8571245803850105
 it pleased father conmee, road and name. 5.224856683665068
 the joybells were ringing in gay malahide. 1.6993430421846631
 lord talbot de malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of malahide and the seas adjoining. 4.448372111287418
 then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day. 6.192189096002158
 those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony. 12.073156506396556
 father conmee, walking, thought of his little book  old times in the  barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of mary rochfort, daughter of lord molesworth, first countess of belvedere. 10.736932675319036
 a listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough ennel, mary, first countess of belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged. 14.62306872864974
 who could know the truth? not the jealous lord belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully,  eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with her husband’s brother? she would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did. 17.050825806474446
 only god knew and she and he, her husband’s brother. 5.170363987342265
 father conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man’s race on earth, and of the ways of god which were not our ways. 9.890397589749016
 don john conmee walked and moved in times of yore. 3.254982342781616
 he was humane and honoured there. 1.7221639658689312
 he bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters. 4.405797524282628
 and the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by don john conmee. 8.669898602916998
 it was a charming day. 2.1013890673580184
 the lychgate of a field showed father conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves. 6.282276069751394
 the sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind. 2.6806875461368116
  moutonner,_ the french said. 3.1673799960797635
 a just and homely word. 6.860030172769467

 corny kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in eccles street flung forth a coin. 5.505763564348927

 boody cried angrily:  crickey, is there nothing for us to eat? katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:  and what’s in this? a heavy fume gushed in answer. 8.737728432583905

 turn now on. 2.803159598952032
 he slid it into the left slot for them. 3.226075170571188
 it shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six. 7.605383241508751
 lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to nisi prius court richie goulding carrying the costbag of goulding, collis and ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king’s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude. 18.888307857813587
  see? he said. 1.2664172982721142
 see now the last one i put in is over here: turns over. 8.8659947333697
 the impact. 1.0
 leverage, see? he showed them the rising column of disks on the right. 3.9136735152812063
  smart idea, nosey flynn said, snuffling. 1.9473402753612108
 so a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over. 9.358260217968363
  see? tom rochford said. 1.3702979617314397
 he slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four. 7.632647130777163
 turn now on. 2.803159598952032
  i’ll see him now in the ormond, lenehan said, and sound him. 4.175532157912033

  do, tom rochford said. 3.1999199539085406
 tell him i’m boylan with impatience. 2.022483457604891
  goodnight, m’coy said abruptly. 2.1522318270032836
 when you two begin. 2.5831243749400485
 nosey flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it. 2.160427795398722
  but how does it work here, tommy? he asked. 4.5158966835156304
  tooraloo, lenehan said. 3.243740986036854
 see you later. 1.0893908090620688
 he followed m’coy out across the tiny square of crampton court. 4.651450391551048
  he’s a hero, he said simply. 2.0109449323851654
  i know, m’coy said. 1.1426467874001076
 the drain, you mean. 1.5393939725808454
  drain? lenehan said. 1.8292536881338646
 it was down a manhole. 2.407882762599897
 they passed dan lowry’s musichall where marie kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile. 3.92553146215651
 going down the path of sycamore street beside the empire musichall lenehan showed m’coy how the whole thing was. 6.965014270851003
 one of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas. 8.300355817693845
 down went tom rochford anyhow, booky’s vest and all, with the rope round him. 6.501720857258273
 and be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up. 4.461718883542822
  the act of a hero, he said. 1.3341958729335182
 at the dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for jervis street. 5.781695941822137
  this way, he said, walking to the right. 3.9085503672780533
 i want to pop into lynam’s to see sceptre’s starting price. 5.213685631519074
 what’s the time by your gold watch and chain? m’coy peered into marcus tertius moses’ sombre office, then at o’neill’s clock. 7.0371868937830655
  after three, he said. 2.8768983202636007
 who’s riding her?  o. 1.5707454898409199
 madden, lenehan said. 3.5773576719569036
 and a game filly she is. 3.7179864283346036
 while he waited in temple bar m’coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. 10.771207324748081
 fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark. 3.990939503971285
 the gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade. 4.078753767083772
  even money, lenehan said returning. 4.5007439301542815
 i knocked against bantam lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn’t an earthly. 4.730629319186089
 through here. 1.0
 they went up the steps and under merchants’ arch. 3.331159565485581
 a darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker’s cart. 2.2203272650308676
  there he is, lenehan said. 3.717723582625345
  wonder what he’s buying, m’coy said, glancing behind. 2.821152734714052
 — leopoldo or the bloom is on the rye,_ lenehan said. 4.929368951600909
  he’s dead nuts on sales, m’coy said. 1.285187671249526
 i was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in liffey street for two bob. 6.330548312279247
 there were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails. 6.000114541349441
 astronomy it was about. 2.939548364799008
 lenehan laughed. 1.0
  i’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails, he said. 3.208778507977033
 come over in the sun. 1.4380811307641255
 they crossed to the metal bridge and went along wellington quay by the riverwall. 5.365360813867902
 master patrick aloysius dignam came out of mangan’s, late fehrenbach’s, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks. 6.4344253674798235
  there was a long spread out at glencree reformatory, lenehan said eagerly. 2.5980501114674897
 the annual dinner, you know. 1.5162982696265468
 boiled shirt affair. 1.0218617843143556
 the lord mayor was there, val dillon it was, and sir charles cameron and dan dawson spoke and there was music. 5.647284872165067
 bartell d’arcy sang and benjamin dollard. 3.9384599222181564
  i know, m’coy broke in. 1.5850446281638073
 my missus sang there once. 2.281859505073947
  did she? lenehan said. 1.6955093043402785
 a card  unfurnished  apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number Number eccles street. 7.78463336870959
 he checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh. 6.235246547978484
  but wait till i tell you, he said. 2.374457167455004
 delahunt of camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. 10.915404325555649
 bloom and the wife were there. 1.9246451734714403
 lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice. 4.567653697401779
 fast and furious it was. 2.547833000192912
 after liquids came solids. 4.967620775569604
 cold joints galore and mince pies. 8.096571999401784
  i know, m’coy said. 1.1426467874001076
 the year the missus was there. 2.2033973131385456
 lenehan linked his arm warmly. 2.2753618770659396
  but wait till i tell you, he said. 2.374457167455004
 we had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the morning after the night before. 6.637596158710863
 coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s night on the featherbed mountain. 4.400067916853915
 bloom and chris callinan were on one side of the car and i was with the wife on the other. 5.531280509251608
 we started singing glees and duets:  lo, the early beam of  morning. 8.451928514813543
 she was well primed with a good load of delahunt’s port under her bellyband. 3.787736213149812
 every jolt the bloody car gave i had her bumping up against me. 8.842036020531948
 hell’s delights! she has a fine pair, god bless her. 2.490272322867235
 like that. 1.0
 he held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:  i was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. 11.59185107220818
 know what i mean? his hands moulded ample curves of air. 2.0663368937744053
 he shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips. 9.138508174664889
  the lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. 2.213901029948607
 she’s a gamey mare and no mistake. 1.5821985642242011
 bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to chris callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. 7.9265128645159235
 but, by god, i was lost, so to speak, in the milky way. 6.3728451299003845
 he knows them all, faith. 1.5234919072869635
 at last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. 5.594282600406
  and what star is that, poldy?_ says she. 4.568654518464791
 by god, she had bloom cornered. 3.4703654582193173
  that one, is it?_ says chris callinan,  sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick. 5.310686493268796
_ by god, he wasn’t far wide of the mark. 3.2461635372433055
 lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter. 4.255834465035797
  i’m weak, he gasped. 2.546422812600438
 m’coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. 5.137634802332486
 lenehan walked on again. 1.6936996127654331
 he lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly. 2.1634301282234625
 he glanced sideways in the sunlight at m’coy. 1.9075614781275434
  he’s a cultured allroundman, bloom is, he said seriously. 6.052924846963091
 he’s not one of your common or garden. 1.9109540914836955
 you know. 1.0
 there’s a touch of the artist about old bloom. 2.5268489936425462
 * * * mr bloom turned over idly pages of  the awful disclosures of maria  monk, then of aristotle’s  masterpiece. 8.422752420284978
_ crooked botched print. 5.556840264834459
 plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows. 7.104302950464713
 lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. 3.8142426096574753
 all butting with their skulls to get out of it. 3.3051809492762856
 child born every minute somewhere. 1.5436606009597438
 mrs purefoy. 1.0
 he laid both books aside and glanced at the third:  tales of the  ghetto by leopold von sacher masoch. 5.265137947320576
  that i had, he said, pushing it by. 4.341228102673013
 the shopman let two volumes fall on the counter. 3.624187853040326
  them are two good ones, he said. 2.537109746002945
 onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth. 2.9788700919793003
 he bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain. 6.864501350287842
 on o’connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of mr denis j maginni, professor of dancing &c. 2.9906504834299863
 mr bloom, alone, looked at the titles. 4.127940062378894
  fair  tyrants by james lovebirch. 3.0968300639768813
 know the kind that is. 1.5321918549750089

 got her it once. 3.879078735534085
 he read the other title:  sweets of  sin. 1.322754885058097
 more in her line. 1.2302011657908007
 let us see. 1.2603559486464448
 he read where his finger opened. 2.395489369296238
 _ all the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. 7.306219192995074
 for him! for raoul!_ yes. 2.9419659132466864
 — her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé. 8.783057238622456
_ yes. 1.0
 take this. 1.0
 the end. 1.0
  you are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare. 5.3072656925048705
 the beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. 4.612347969038547
 an imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly. 5.373509057437087
 mr bloom read again:  the beautiful woman. 1.7912862085672836
_ warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. 5.4822231838090865
 flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. 6.36272058205823
 his nostrils arched themselves for prey. 2.9508872241282464
 melting breast ointments ( for him! for raoul!_). 4.69900583969071
 armpits’ oniony sweat. 2.844921119859992
 fishgluey slime ( her heaving embonpoint!_). 3.8551441134457267
 feel! press! crished! sulphur dung of lions! young! young! an elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king’s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor’s court the case in lunacy of potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the lady cairns versus the owners of the barque mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of harvey versus the ocean accident and guarantee corporation. 47.922218208143796
 phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains. 4.594958559849541
 the shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing. 6.974255254037001
 he raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor. 3.7703029169252975
 he put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired. 9.428702941143523
 mr bloom beheld it. 1.1754808861301183
 mastering his troubled breath, he said:  i’ll take this one. 2.2760664155524717
 the shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum. 6.7140088089111
 — sweets of sin,_ he said, tapping on it. 3.274384404472677
 that’s a good one. 1.1946929934533697
 * * * the lacquey by the door of dillon’s auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet. 11.243270814264893
 dilly dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within. 9.35643730469597

 gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the college library. 5.2935893556140785
 mr dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from williams’s row. 8.205503557635273
 he halted near his daughter. 1.1114449565774402
  it’s time for you, she said. 2.656989177146586
  stand up straight for the love of the lord jesus, mr dedalus said. 1.8323408683194446
 are you trying to imitate your uncle john, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder? melancholy god! dilly shrugged her shoulders. 8.878016070567902
 mr dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back. 3.0390241424701765
  stand up straight, girl, he said. 2.053097503731221
 you’ll get curvature of the spine. 2.7323409162937113
 do you know what you look like? he let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw. 5.898207217860067
  give it up, father, dilly said. 2.5843685541465717
 all the people are looking at you. 4.366474118622952
 mr dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache. 2.3990689701484773
  did you get any money? dilly asked. 1.7705680825005898
  where would i get money? mr dedalus said. 2.236383427096227
 there is no one in dublin would lend me fourpence. 2.085872546166883
  you got some, dilly said, looking in his eyes. 2.5452077994896114
  how do you know that? mr dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek. 2.3942720606604824
 mr kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along james’s street. 6.084380174623875
  i know you did, dilly answered. 2.7940897328602086
 were you in the scotch house now?  i was not, then, mr dedalus said, smiling. 4.983192825487751
 was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy? here. 4.864760035110871
 he handed her a shilling. 1.5252609413841784
  see if you can do anything with that, he said. 2.1752721357929077
  i suppose you got five, dilly said. 2.3193800569090692
 give me more than that. 1.5593269011334112
  wait awhile, mr dedalus said threateningly. 2.254638064381269
 you’re like the rest of them, are you? an insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died. 9.195237377544132
 but wait awhile. 1.0184499226648978
 you’ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me. 4.436267330143105
 low blackguardism! i’m going to get rid of you. 3.2240548107102103
 wouldn’t care if i was stretched out stiff. 1.8384713745926757
 he’s dead. 1.0
 the man upstairs is dead. 1.3776313440529593
 he left her and walked on. 2.8192276202364113
 dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat. 2.201599636345214
  well, what is it? he said, stopping. 2.6943103185023136
 the lacquey rang his bell behind their backs. 1.7220276831025811
  barang!  curse your bloody blatant soul, mr dedalus cried, turning on him. 2.823956482188122
 the lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly:  bang! mr dedalus stared at him. 4.465643823859352
  watch him, he said. 1.595772016302286
 it’s instructive. 1.0
 i wonder will he allow us to talk. 2.527344893577186
  you got more than that, father, dilly said. 2.635407811765328
  i’m going to show you a little trick, mr dedalus said. 1.789534994888788
 i’ll leave you all where jesus left the jews. 3.0766333399005554
 look, there’s all i have. 2.7672913105117827
 i got two shillings from jack power and i spent twopence for a shave for the funeral. 2.7992337556560516
 he drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously. 2.173140221047356
  can’t you look for some money somewhere? dilly said. 1.9021925633657975
 mr dedalus thought and nodded. 3.963040650688252
  i will, he said gravely. 2.4066535588506426
 i looked all along the gutter in o’connell street. 2.536253377596584
 i’ll try this one now. 1.583292436188359
  you’re very funny, dilly said, grinning. 2.0695689055813355

 he stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which mr dedalus flicked fluff, saying:  they were made for a man in his health, ben, anyhow. 11.50986540659119

 ben dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air. 5.469432300693629
  come along with me to the subsheriff’s office, he said. 1.9140900890259076
 i want to show you the new beauty rock has for a bailiff. 3.386427645359709
 he’s a cross between lobengula and lynchehaun. 3.297285717942392
 he’s well worth seeing, mind you. 2.8083599740456084
 come along. 1.0
 i saw john henry menton casually in the bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if i don’t. 5.314070745922035
 wait awhile. 1.0
 we’re on the right lay, bob, believe you me. 4.389209876764502
  for a few days tell him, father cowley said anxiously. 2.2063120351450665
 ben dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright. 11.99725306816766
  what few days? he boomed. 1.769917735066611
 hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?  he has, father cowley said. 3.8629269244035704
  then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, ben dollard said. 4.059249769212071
 the landlord has the prior claim. 2.2072468350047023
 i gave him all the particulars. 1.4376473710625488
 Number windsor avenue. 14.405076519904359
 love is the name?  that’s right, father cowley said. 3.628970480611665
 the reverend mr love. 1.3524116082164426
 he’s a minister in the country somewhere. 1.9210957698198852
 but are you sure of that?  you can tell barabbas from me, ben dollard said, that he can put that writ where jacko put the nuts. 10.209882274362036
 he led father cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk. 3.582603636592774
  filberts i believe they were, mr dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them. 4.943421610967515
 * * *  the youngster will be all right, martin cunningham said, as they passed out of the castleyard gate. 5.179322343837547
 the policeman touched his forehead. 1.4759357389738936
  god bless you, martin cunningham said, cheerily. 2.3604876897415323
 he signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards lord edward street. 6.810076001616971
 bronze by gold, miss kennedy’s head by miss douce’s head, appeared above the crossblind of the ormond hotel. 3.366391334937765
  yes, martin cunningham said, fingering his beard. 1.8292378875746194
 i wrote to father conmee and laid the whole case before him. 2.9995385600027915
  you could try our friend, mr power suggested backward. 1.6902741672795518
  boyd? martin cunningham said shortly. 1.619200418707719
 touch me not. 1.1903860911759978
 john wyse nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down cork hill. 7.926251932344569
 on the steps of the city hall councillor nannetti, descending, hailed alderman cowley and councillor abraham lyon ascending. 5.703742536281479
 the castle car wheeled empty into upper exchange street. 1.5252572927994805
  look here, martin, john wyse nolan said, overtaking them at the  mail office. 2.967852313375948
 i see bloom put his name down for five shillings. 3.029973467818858
  quite right, martin cunningham said, taking the list. 2.6063159423669893
 and put down the five shillings too. 1.8317334613846716
  without a second word either, mr power said. 1.8344838420417842
  strange but true, martin cunningham added. 3.2090502294204937
 john wyse nolan opened wide eyes. 1.289344166676172
  i’ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly. 4.181898203639645
 they went down parliament street. 1.056725931489267
  there’s jimmy henry, mr power said, just heading for kavanagh’s. 3.3486416106000125
  righto, martin cunningham said. 2.030159353981021
 here goes. 1.0
 outside  la maison  claire blazes boylan waylaid jack mooney’s brother inlaw, humpy, tight, making for the liberties. 14.630690932758357
 john wyse nolan fell back with mr power, while martin cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past micky anderson’s watches. 5.9665209935935275
  the assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble, john wyse nolan told mr power. 3.4934448475798865
 they followed round the corner towards james kavanagh’s winerooms. 1.8123520393236747
 the empty castle car fronted them at rest in essex gate. 3.593498256265962
 martin cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which jimmy henry did not glance. 11.372353656022703
  and long john fanning is here too, john wyse nolan said, as large as life. 4.2116052028548925
 the tall form of long john fanning filled the doorway where he stood. 2.147100572892292
  good day, mr subsheriff, martin cunningham said, as all halted and greeted. 6.349559751771106
 long john fanning made no way for them. 2.221315913130898
 he removed his large henry clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces. 5.966038942805169
  are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk. 5.784346540285268
 hell open to christians they were having, jimmy henry said pettishly, about their damned irish language. 7.420527776511737
 where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber. 4.088082878840411
 and old barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and hutchinson, the lord mayor, in llandudno and little lorcan sherlock doing  locum  tenens for him. 27.814495467895895
 damned irish language, language of our forefathers. 4.1141426159197865
 long john fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips. 1.6600500221709793
 martin cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while john wyse nolan held his peace. 7.978370194722358
  what dignam was that? long john fanning asked. 3.0640558318930378
 jimmy henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot. 2.2581502056035516
  o, my corns! he said plaintively. 2.2733208906053575
 come upstairs for goodness’ sake till i sit down somewhere. 2.298609695751346
 uff! ooo! mind! testily he made room for himself beside long john fanning’s flank and passed in and up the stairs. 13.921633671170898
  come on up, martin cunningham said to the subsheriff. 2.8113632891388374
 i don’t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though. 4.981100538240142
 with john wyse nolan mr power followed them in. 2.0561013970022963
  decent little soul he was, mr power said to the stalwart back of long john fanning ascending towards long john fanning in the mirror. 5.338522576781273
  rather lowsized. 1.0
 dignam of menton’s office that was, martin cunningham said. 4.523871718460741
 long john fanning could not remember him. 1.1592096112114179
 clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air. 3.327649726078693
  what’s that? martin cunningham said. 1.7035420557897587
 all turned where they stood. 3.2735677935249
 john wyse nolan came down again. 1.3097474919507137
 from the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. 4.782708518543579
 gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. 5.222093847672953
 in saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders. 3.5505879912826868
  what was it? martin cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase. 2.8319636557893517
  the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of ireland, john wyse nolan answered from the stairfoot. 3.065039666472081
 * * * as they trod across the thick carpet buck mulligan whispered behind his panama to haines:  parnell’s brother. 9.303973468747538
 there in the corner. 1.160351769413188
 they chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard. 5.965400317417633
  is that he? haines asked, twisting round in his seat. 2.565322578708684
  yes, mulligan said. 1.7663346879574957
 that’s john howard, his brother, our city marshal. 2.7521966842459444
 john howard parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. 4.295068706825707
 an instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner. 10.931976043280095
  i’ll take a  mélange,_ haines said to the waitress. 2.531138625927331
  two  mélanges,_ buck mulligan said. 2.598767840610162
 and bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well. 3.8177854705749277
 when she had gone he said, laughing:  we call it d. 4.196221441441081
 because they have damn bad cakes. 1.2566184416970099
 o, but you missed dedalus on  hamlet. 5.5909250855474815
_ haines opened his newbought book. 1.978876785324618
  i’m sorry, he said. 2.2864783946590874
 shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance. 6.4646807778674145
 the onelegged sailor growled at the area of Number nelson street: — england  expects. 3.28414569482815
 buck mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter. 1.3642949436512906
  you should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. 3.298728581015984
 wandering ængus i call him. 1.2534523462647886
  i am sure he has an  idée fixe,_ haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. 3.5594158977038215
 now i am speculating what it would be likely to be. 3.746027375613104
 such persons always have. 1.3284645545037614
 buck mulligan bent across the table gravely. 1.1173752928957288
  they drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. 4.239531435590425
 he will never capture the attic note. 3.6523953959921336
 the note of swinburne, of all poets, the white death and the ruddy birth. 8.365785911733495
 that is his tragedy. 1.180233393702625
 he can never be a poet. 1.5142321574642068
 the joy of creation. 1.3473346856227975
  eternal punishment, haines said, nodding curtly. 3.054743856657858
 i see. 1.0
 i tackled him this morning on belief. 2.074542775467886
 there was something on his mind, i saw. 2.1489011237753055
 it’s rather interesting because professor pokorny of vienna makes an interesting point out of that. 5.219473761309965
 buck mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come. 1.5205084809071034
 he helped her to unload her tray. 3.2141883835109044
  he can find no trace of hell in ancient irish myth, haines said, amid the cheerful cups. 2.8049047318880844
 the moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution. 7.090121723034533
 rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. 3.5078014712297394
 does he write anything for your movement? he sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream. 3.118665914461986
 buck mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith. 5.342289293580367
 he bit off a soft piece hungrily. 3.403390174056727
  ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. 5.9370446326937065
 he is going to write something in ten years. 1.8380679257614803
  seems a long way off, haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon. 4.478497642330059
 still, i shouldn’t wonder if he did after all. 6.70543852892072
 he tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup. 4.353413105736791
  this is real irish cream i take it, he said with forbearance. 2.9613665132823708
 i don’t want to be imposed on. 1.4589054658349816
 elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new wapping street past benson’s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner  rosevean from bridgwater with bricks. 16.175783903879275
 * * * almidano artifoni walked past holles street, past sewell’s yard. 4.655781726975177
 behind him cashel boyle o’connor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before mr law smith’s house and, crossing, walked along merrion square. 5.270191290163083
 distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of college park. 2.5732513482664503
 cashel boyle o’connor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell walked as far as mr lewis werner’s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling. 5.319650580867874
 at the corner of wilde’s house he halted, frowned at elijah’s name announced on the metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke’s lawn. 10.063790859274926
 his eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. 1.8825406945582726
 with ratsteeth bared he muttered: — coactus volui. 4.260376274768
_ he strode on for clare street, grinding his fierce word. 2.8364385517557755
 as he strode past mr bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body. 8.554527018195884
 the blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form. 2.783273824559758
  god’s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! you’re blinder nor i am, you bitch’s bastard! * * * opposite ruggy o’donohoe’s master patrick aloysius dignam, pawing the pound and a half of mangan’s, late fehrenbach’s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm wicklow street dawdling. 13.664105658936652
 it was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with mrs stoer and mrs quigley and mrs macdowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle barney brought from tunney’s. 10.640419913705708
 and they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing. 6.00717956309101
 after wicklow lane the window of madame doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him. 4.210172597102095
 he stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props. 5.96898380080221
 from the sidemirrors two mourning masters dignam gaped silently. 4.673653350630329
 myler keogh, dublin’s pet lamb, will meet sergeantmajor bennett, the portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns. 4.666619420534852
 gob, that’d be a good pucking match to see. 2.731750039847176
 myler keogh, that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. 4.6226220686341115
 two bar entrance, soldiers half price. 2.4996530234501226
 i could easy do a bunk on ma. 2.8804971697021435
 master dignam on his left turned as he turned. 4.41850867605731
 that’s me in mourning. 1.8694820634980613
 when is it? may the twentysecond. 4.102589570671883
 sure, the blooming thing is all over. 2.954959784605075
 he turned to the right and on his right master dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up. 5.635023377419395
 buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of marie kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. 6.785454454141051
 one of them mots that do be in the packets of fags stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out. 12.53465333739199
 master dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. 5.1995129067144426
 the best pucker going for strength was fitzsimons. 3.737962071486295
 one puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man. 5.287309488924884
 but the best pucker for science was jem corbet before fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all. 10.478905977261732
 in grafton street master dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time. 7.490151119860673
 no sandymount tram. 1.6498349241806503
 master dignam walked along nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand. 2.9264820761819994
 his collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. 2.029276781018293
 the blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it. 8.636508149461717
 he met schoolboys with satchels. 1.3507951369326032
 i’m not going tomorrow either, stay away till monday. 3.6930762588361903
 he met other schoolboys. 2.0872971855060998
 do they notice i’m in mourning? uncle barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight. 2.7452124872947956
 then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s name. 10.326595097971527
 his face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye. 7.876397938159011
 the scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs. 6.402243986177785
 pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle barney telling the men how to get it round the bend. 8.704342826721454
 a big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking. 5.794791394371898
 how was that? the last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to tunney’s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. 13.356890967139933
 never see him again. 1.37833482423953
 death, that is. 1.5750376916267226
 pa is dead. 1.334756485537808
 my father is dead. 1.2014424965338901
 he told me to be a good son to ma. 2.0808446794647875
 i couldn’t hear the other things he said but i saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. 3.5916123907924473
 poor pa. 1.0
 that was mr dignam, my father. 1.8883623805030694
 i hope he’s in purgatory now because he went to confession to father conroy on saturday night. 2.312068269881724
 * * * william humble, earl of dudley, and lady dudley, accompanied by lieutenantcolonel heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge. 8.641277065439146
 in the following carriage were the honourable mrs paget, miss de courcy and the honourable gerald ward a. 5.258533021618505
 in attendance. 1.0
 the cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past kingsbridge along the northern quays. 4.560242050575639
 the viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis. 3.0636634528266082
 at bloody bridge mr thomas kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar. 2.6889528684443644
 between queen’s and whitworth bridges lord dudley’s viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by mr dudley white, b. 8.859540155777621
, m. 1.0
, who stood on arran quay outside mrs m. 2.8500286728286928
 white’s, the pawnbroker’s, at the corner of arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through smithfield, constitution hill and broadstone terminus. 20.19902154782116
 in the porch of four courts richie goulding with the costbag of goulding, collis and ward saw him with surprise. 4.815196456387594
 past richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of reuben j dodd, solicitor, agent for the patriotic insurance company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by king’s windows smiled credulously on the representative of his majesty. 14.371492236831202
 from its sluice in wood quay wall under tom devan’s office poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage. 7.176113602273326
 above the crossblind of the ormond hotel, gold by bronze, miss kennedy’s head by miss douce’s head watched and admired. 6.044466552886615
 on ormond quay mr simon dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff’s office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. 9.082381613761425
 his excellency graciously returned mr dedalus’ greeting. 1.3852314334298295
 from cahill’s corner the reverend hugh c. 4.5832336902113555
 love, m. 3.391628574855506

 tempting poor simple males. 1.3092979669132658
 miss douce of satin douced her arm away. 2.6505749951336814
  o go away! she said. 1.591366306758501

  you must have been a doaty, miss douce made answer. 2.7782291779881834
 and what did the doctor order today?  well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. 4.326875631305232
 i think i’ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky. 2.9998520953776255
  with the greatest alacrity, miss douce agreed. 1.6700032950688493
 with grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt cantrell and cochrane’s she turned herself. 3.321365688231824
 with grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg. 3.978133651794102
 forth from the skirt of his coat mr dedalus brought pouch and pipe. 3.9061658939695048
 alacrity she served. 1.4088748452883404
 he blew through the flue two husky fifenotes. 2.6979593649618456
  by jove, he mused, i often wanted to see the mourne mountains. 2.311657209338906

 he fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid’s, into the bowl. 7.719312951896491
 none nought said nothing. 1.2970032294561629
 gaily miss douce polished a tumbler, trilling: — o, idolores, queen of the eastern seas!_  was mr lidwell in today? in came lenehan. 7.397011784675743

  was mr boylan looking for me? he asked. 2.1265591076687937
 she answered:  miss kennedy, was mr boylan in while i was upstairs? she asked. 6.661907918161013
 miss voice of kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page:  no. 6.521656747987558
 he was not. 1.114165117900455

 said thee fox too thee stork: will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone? he droned in vain. 11.083919125793841
 miss douce turned to her tea aside. 2.2943163172985708
 he sighed aside:  ah me! o my! he greeted mr dedalus and got a nod. 6.990600568882994
  greetings from the famous son of a famous father. 2.5734961871732365

 lenehan opened most genial arms. 2.2504092542400294
 who?  who may he be? he asked. 6.4066961865574354

 mr dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe. 5.191371553825233
  i see, he said. 1.383254915964977
 i didn’t recognise him for the moment. 2.3163006351567232

_ he had received the rhino for the labour of his muse. 2.5242400664548996
 he smiled at bronze’s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:  the  élite of erin hung upon his lips. 11.538785454860301
 the ponderous pundit, hugh machugh, dublin’s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the o’madden burke. 9.546321785987578

  the tuner was in today, miss douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and i never heard such an exquisite player. 4.104337807522747

 pat paid for diner’s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss douce. 13.015879734725507

 she rose and closed her reading, rose of castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose. 9.389225591680988
  did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her. 4.0340373834193874

  come around to barney kiernan’s, says joe. 1.3214841021675208

 i want to give the citizen the hard word about it. 2.486566535988908
 so we went around by the linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another. 4.340851286973908
 decent fellow joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it. 6.609847237910162
 jesus, i couldn’t get over that bloody foxy geraghty, the daylight robber. 2.491403440186822
 for trading without a licence, says he. 1.2139019622963376
 in inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy michan. 7.432813144490415
 there rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. 2.52595606215969
 there sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. 7.5481513306638774
 a pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. 25.960505917419642
 in the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. 29.460029403466095
 lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. 27.470448691987514
 and heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from eblana to slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered munster and of connacht the just and of smooth sleek leinster and of cruachan’s land and of armagh the splendid and of the noble district of boyle, princes, the sons of kings. 40.321495466833305
 and there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for o’connell fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. 19.986488065769
 thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, york and savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes. 54.896236832475765
 i dare him, says he, and i doubledare him. 2.905732709751759
 so we turned into barney kiernan’s and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink. 13.398450818443518
  there he is, says i, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause. 5.859387429055922
 the bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. 4.9431677298008845
 be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. 5.27224754105501
 i’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence. 10.102455280824373
  stand and deliver, says he. 1.42013794847694
  that’s all right, citizen, says joe. 2.1280463441775295
 friends here. 1.0
  pass, friends, says he. 2.3013215109426954
 then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:  what’s your opinion of the times? doing the rapparee and rory of the hill. 6.572759089577213
 but, begob, joe was equal to the occasion. 4.2678251827766625
  i think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork. 5.383628035987783
 so begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:  foreign wars is the cause of it. 3.751189220083877
 and says joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:  it’s the russians wish to tyrannise. 4.442899709417451
  arrah, give over your bloody codding, joe, says i. 4.603323177608445
 i’ve a thirst on me i wouldn’t sell for half a crown. 4.81253706604615
  give it a name, citizen, says joe. 2.408695032250375
  wine of the country, says he. 2.7751807070332934
  what’s yours? says joe. 1.0909752582366128
  ditto macanaspey, says i. 1.67937056981793
  three pints, terry, says joe. 2.937925843547525
 and how’s the old heart, citizen? says he. 2.6176060340382374
  never better,  a  chara, says he. 2.394151150249081
 what garry? are we going to win? eh? and with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by jesus, he near throttled him. 8.699702929127957
 the figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. 24.02276002827787
 from shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse ( ulex  europeus). 13.038236990972722
 the widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. 12.547540155618705
 the eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. 12.444018181333083
 a powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble. 24.746670489687503
 he wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. 11.5242655062209
 beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. 5.1238855693542575
 his nether extremities were encased in high balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. 17.06391552814967
 from his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, cuchulin, conn of hundred battles, niall of nine hostages, brian of kincora, the ardri malachi, art macmurragh, shane o’neill, father john murphy, owen roe, patrick sarsfield, red hugh o’donnell, red jim macdermott, soggarth eoghan o’growney, michael dwyer, francy higgins, henry joy m’cracken, goliath, horace wheatley, thomas conneff, peg woffington, the village blacksmith, captain moonlight, captain boycott, dante alighieri, christopher columbus, s. 58.50556221339271

 a couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone. 27.857384777428187
 so anyhow terry brought the three pints joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when i saw him land out a quid. 8.21420393968834
 o, as true as i’m telling you. 2.563180956012527

  and there’s more where that came from, says he. 3.180378434434177
  were you robbing the poorbox, joe? says i. 4.1379256782275995
  sweat of my brow, says joe. 1.6065795561878866
 ’twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze. 3.6835860036084758
  i saw him before i met you, says i, sloping around by pill lane and greek street with his cod’s eye counting up all the guts of the fish. 4.835320361890173
 who comes through michan’s land, bedight in sable armour? o’bloom, the son of rory: it is he. 10.409070914051473
 impervious to fear is rory’s son: he of the prudent soul. 11.149896553168318

 how’s that for a national press, eh, my brown son! how’s that for martin murphy, the bantry jobber?  ah, well, says joe, handing round the boose. 12.674092682255313
 thanks be to god they had the start of us. 4.019016493661973
 drink that, citizen. 1.6764363757773983

  health, joe, says i. 3.495408800921603
 and all down the form. 2.2849070973007417
 ah! ow! don’t be talking! i was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. 6.575260228730955
 declare to god i could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click. 2.689186562201992
 and lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race. 20.54530980751082
 little alf bergan popped in round the door and hid behind barney’s snug, squeezed up with the laughing. 7.041937978705008
 and who was sitting up there in the corner that i hadn’t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only bob doran. 7.494694949425553
 i didn’t know what was up and alf kept making signs out of the door. 2.349826402082327
 and begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon denis breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. 7.869324195913601
 i thought alf would split. 1.5174369693910932
  look at him, says he. 1.189769229050641
 he’s traipsing all round dublin with a postcard someone sent him with u. 4.856768512639334
 p: up on it to take a li. 2.98195896425521
 and he doubled up. 1.0537798988566118
  take a what? says i. 2.854705707542922
  libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds. 2.529919413960229
  o hell! says i. 1.178847243732233
 the bloody mongrel began to growl that’d put the fear of god in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs. 5.431119930892576
 _ bi i dho husht,_ says he. 5.429372510210303
  who? says joe. 1.0421638221280203
  breen, says alf. 1.3299303406961227
 he was in john henry menton’s and then he went round to collis and ward’s and then tom rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff’s for a lark. 6.2347354678499745
 o god, i’ve a pain laughing. 2.698101540372673
 p: up. 1.223919629692852
 the long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to green street to look for a g man. 7.787880879241476
  when is long john going to hang that fellow in mountjoy? says joe. 4.826578687275639
  bergan, says bob doran, waking up. 2.3409015432589397
 is that alf bergan?  yes, says alf. 3.324196211155412
 hanging? wait till i show you. 1.784322401901058
 here, terry, give us a pony. 2.1132213956898362
 that bloody old fool! ten thousand pounds. 1.5135464660159064
 you should have seen long john’s eye. 3.411685161853396
 and he started laughing. 1.6412317416568694
  who are you laughing at? says bob doran. 1.6224749852824278
 is that bergan?  hurry up, terry boy, says alf. 3.692412769876074
 terence o’ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers bungiveagh and bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless leda. 17.6019401340522
 for they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat. 20.727650103677064
 then did you, chivalrous terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals. 16.983599493306198
 but he, the young chief of the o’bergan’s, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. 10.050242729794949
 thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of brunswick, victoria her name, her most excellent majesty, by grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and of the british dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, empress of india, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop. 49.432788951182694
  what’s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?  what’s that? says joe. 5.971470695776299
  here you are, says alf, chucking out the rhino. 4.020908984954811
 talking about hanging, i’ll show you something you never saw. 4.248686157431803
 hangmen’s letters. 1.0
 look at here. 1.7399961794340137
 so he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket. 4.395878848623138
  are you codding? says i. 1.8844840357147714
  honest injun, says alf. 1.9474307154159929
 read them. 1.0
 so joe took up the letters. 1.4065278190786084
  who are you laughing at? says bob doran. 1.6224749852824278
 so i saw there was going to be a bit of a dust. 2.4611534052404873
 bob’s a queer chap when the porter’s up in him so says i just to make talk:  how’s willy murray those times, alf?  i don’t know, says alf. 8.052178034984012
 i saw him just now in capel street with paddy dignam. 2.340704796091355
 only i was running after that. 1.9733200695207325
  you what? says joe, throwing down the letters. 1.7522916041424141
 with who?  with dignam, says alf. 4.8175830549033005
  is it paddy? says joe. 3.332101437060942
  yes, says alf. 1.0730412924770578
 why?  don’t you know he’s dead? says joe. 4.113705026724697
  paddy dignam dead! says alf. 1.486886188174958
  ay, says joe. 1.0339546969849969
  sure i’m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says alf, as plain as a pikestaff. 4.348531300196165
  who’s dead? says bob doran. 1.562666262594183
  you saw his ghost then, says joe, god between us and harm. 5.779000979799459
  what? says alf. 1.0317990917468312
 good christ, only five. 3.8217185585244153
 what?. 1.0
 and willy murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim’s. 3.771560674768744
 what? dignam dead?  what about dignam? says bob doran. 3.7571931272914387
 who’s talking about. 1.0672532945856132
?  dead! says alf. 1.4185028802874222
 he’s no more dead than you are. 2.080254109102175
  maybe so, says joe. 1.715101013683877
 they took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow. 2.273770057305925
  paddy? says alf. 1.547914019620006
  ay, says joe. 1.0339546969849969
 he paid the debt of nature, god be merciful to him. 4.4301407986182095
  good christ! says alf. 1.3435420568300847
 begob he was what you might call flabbergasted. 3.005213059720163
 in the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. 15.448451201019411
 communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. 11.848867245581712
 questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. 14.138253751334874
 in reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. 18.650069177379102
 interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. 19.39983492841539
 having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. 8.69941673590438
 asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that mars and jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. 18.164412433880415
 it was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was:  we greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. 11.262051629258254
 mind c. 1.0
 doesn’t pile it on. 1.5895181202741928
_ it was ascertained that the reference was to mr cornelius kelleher, manager of messrs h. 9.47931803931374
 o’neill’s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. 7.864265317085206
 before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still good. 14.431185772052556
 he stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known. 6.091892074872695
 assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction. 7.995821416408459
 he is gone from mortal haunts: o’dignam, sun of our morning. 5.972469161351863
 fleet was his foot on the bracken: patrick of the beamy brow. 6.694186047448352
 wail, banba, with your wind: and wail, o ocean, with your whirlwind. 7.88272192620192
  there he is again, says the citizen, staring out. 2.939951775017192
  who? says i. 1.0885178014251276
  bloom, says he. 1.184523938302501
 he’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes. 3.5406269031521274
 and, begob, i saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again. 11.510874124539
 little alf was knocked bawways. 2.2061222067965267
 faith, he was. 3.2573357574887614
  good christ! says he. 1.363345676191017
 i could have sworn it was him. 3.831879299421759
 and says bob doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in dublin when he’s under the influence:  who said christ is good?  i beg your parsnips, says alf. 11.529706312729468
  is that a good christ, says bob doran, to take away poor little willy dignam?  ah, well, says alf, trying to pass it off. 5.937253724016617
 he’s over all his troubles. 2.1254084838735103
 but bob doran shouts out of him. 1.4632943483823349
  he’s a bloody ruffian, i say, to take away poor little willy dignam. 2.680889355820361
 terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn’t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. 6.7639416798100465
 and bob doran starts doing the weeps about paddy dignam, true as you’re there. 4.299982138206578
  the finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character. 7.118719403616904
 the tear is bloody near your eye. 3.5787786748661286
 talking through his bloody hat. 1.876960270524318
 fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, mooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings bantam lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour. 27.776640709279132
  the noblest, the truest, says he. 3.5709220533692068
 and he’s gone, poor little willy, poor little paddy dignam. 2.8590869671987265
 and mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven. 5.767802178248747
 old garryowen started growling again at bloom that was skeezing round the door. 3.643276071019214
  come in, come on, he won’t eat you, says the citizen. 5.83527706006822
 so bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks terry was martin cunningham there. 4.984124009087379
  o, christ m’keown, says joe, reading one of the letters. 5.646451268639536
 listen to this, will you? and he starts reading out one. 6.226380337333371
  Number hunter street, liverpool. 1.3590955372236786
_  to the high sheriff of dublin, dublin. 6.108344063712089
_  honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged joe gann in bootle jail on the Number of febuary Number and i hanged. 9.528062644232703
_  show us, joe, says i. 3.693107072285319
 private arthur chace for fowl murder of jessie tilsit in pentonville prison and i was assistant when. 5.771411300591581
_  jesus, says i. 1.488643640404584
 billington executed the awful murderer toad smith. 6.3891709024211805
_ the citizen made a grab at the letter. 2.3839232302170044
  hold hard, says joe,  i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees. 10.866091217679203
_  h. 1.0
 rumbold, master barber. 2.0804724341757876
_  and a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen. 6.265272773585532
  and the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says joe. 3.2267833033954916
 here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, alf. 4.284099236451481
 hello, bloom, says he, what will you have? so they started arguing about the point, bloom saying he wouldn’t and he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he’d just take a cigar. 13.726954566055502
 gob, he’s a prudent member and no mistake. 1.489770006530217
  give us one of your prime stinkers, terry, says joe. 2.6858268472471325
 and alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it. 5.529353474990865
  they’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses. 6.997617222442468
 and he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull. 9.59559397662638
 in the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. 6.3047399335392775
 their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for i will on nowise suffer it even so saith the lord. 14.020359901232293
 so they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time i’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about i don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on. 15.499138250858447
  there’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on, says alf. 3.003939922157148
  what’s that? says joe. 1.2210273566693897
  the poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged, says alf. 2.6977205145308054
  that so? says joe. 1.7622148521187722
  god’s truth, says alf. 1.074150424797681
 i heard that from the head warder that was in kilmainham when they hanged joe brady, the invincible. 6.101458681740654
 he told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker. 3.92290468979342
  ruling passion strong in death, says joe, as someone said. 3.1485416297380415
  that can be explained by science, says bloom. 1.2327724809726073
 it’s only a natural phenomenon, don’t you see, because on account of the. 2.61149748657153
 and then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon. 5.171088022557835
 the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the  corpora  cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection  in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis. 58.68892903478079
_ so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new ireland and new this, that and the other. 22.515073165869296
 talking about new ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. 4.269206377688483
 mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. 5.121350550887689
 and round he goes to bob doran that was standing alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. 7.443270256264195
 so of course bob doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:  give us the paw! give the paw, doggy! good old doggy! give the paw here! give us the paw! arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. 23.054972891425717
 then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a jacobs’ tin he told terry to bring. 4.172786267906741
 gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. 8.310512738204206
 near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel. 5.67453277811091
 and the citizen and bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers sheares and wolfe tone beyond on arbour hill and robert emmet and die for your country, the tommy moore touch about sara curran and she’s far from the land. 10.773144009768634
 and bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. 5.78710881306352
 phenomenon! the fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. 5.421980262434738
 time they were stopping up in the  city  arms pisser burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. 17.984110931853674
 and one time he led him the rounds of dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn’t near roast him, it’s a queer story, the old one, bloom’s wife and mrs o’dowd that kept the hotel. 19.416024350474213
 jesus, i had to laugh at pisser burke taking them off chewing the fat. 2.495399351662249
 and bloom with his  but don’t you see?_ and  but on the other  hand. 5.093493448305406
 and sure, more be token, the lout i’m told was in power’s after, the blender’s, round in cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. 28.15406194675348
 phenomenon!  the memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at bloom. 7.032330789168509
  ay, ay, says joe. 3.021035469275359
  you don’t grasp my point, says bloom. 2.110781904581017
 what i mean is. 2.592497906604371
 — sinn fein!_ says the citizen. 1.4052225779325598
  sinn fein amhain!_ the friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us. 10.009408924822557
 the last farewell was affecting in the extreme. 1.3006026283685639
 from the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. 15.35114475757107
 the deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. 14.384493493746954
 a torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. 9.16644364649198
 a posse of dublin metropolitan police superintended by the chief commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the york street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by speranza’s plaintive muse. 26.831435189274146
 special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. 5.190723298649747
 considerable amusement was caused by the favourite dublin streetsingers l nh n and m llg n who sang  the night before larry was  stretched in their usual mirth provoking fashion. 10.846211829231047
 our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. 14.74596971450736
 the children of the male and female foundling hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the little sisters of the poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. 24.468334005799075
 the viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by their excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the friends of the emerald isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. 9.117760146969623
 the delegation, present in full force, consisted of commendatore bacibaci beninobenone (the semiparalysed  doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), monsieur pierrepaul petitépatant, the grandjoker vladinmire pokethankertscheff, the archjoker leopold rudolph von schwanzenbad hodenthaler, countess marha virága kisászony putrápesthi, hiram y. 29.66575657222581
 bomboost, count athanatos karamelopulos, ali baba backsheesh rahat lokum effendi, señor hidalgo caballero don pecadillo y palabras y paternoster de la malora de la malaria, hokopoko harakiri, hi hung chang, olaf kobberkeddelsen, mynheer trik van trumps, pan poleaxe paddyrisky, goosepond prhklstr kratchinabritchisitch, borus hupinkoff, herr hurhausdirektorpresident hans chuechli steuerli, nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor kriegfried ueberallgemein. 56.06647665911969
 all the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. 11.937191765633413
 an animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the f. 11.72301053127739
 as to whether the eighth or the ninth of march was the correct date of the birth of ireland’s patron saint. 4.7568254908352054
 in the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. 14.174120549885583
 the baby policeman, constable macfadden, summoned by special courier from booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. 21.956666015991104
 the readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. 7.261534817330992
 constable macfadden was heartily congratulated by all the f. 7.670887657348249
, several of whom were bleeding profusely. 1.7160968808565111
 commendatore beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser avvocato pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. 18.114576685671484
 the objects (which included several hundred ladies’ and gentlemen’s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme. 7.6263624707239845
 quietly, unassumingly rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the  gladiolus  cruentus. 16.010940412361215
 he announced his presence by that gentle rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. 8.130435443278188
 the arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries,  hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive,  allah, amid which the ringing  evviva of the delegate of the land of song (a high double f recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. 39.68188107093227
 it was exactly seventeen o’clock. 1.0681913118797768
 the signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, dr pippi. 13.78650494379812
 the learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. 19.88328050681042
 hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. 20.260906624494677
 as he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. 15.646431721798082
 on a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, messrs john round and sons, sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. 34.945923654081085
 the housesteward of the amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. 9.388757602033268
 quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem. 40.26697975620592
 the  nec and  non plus  ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. 9.700861979784241
 the hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly  sheila, my  own. 8.39297509646993
 encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. 14.829944463504255
 she swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in clonturk park. 13.981534398206879
 she brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of anna liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. 19.425306499866743
 that monster audience simply rocked with delight. 2.5226566427493253
 but anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. 3.1355409553060953
 a fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. 18.258387178980193
 big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. 8.77681961131673
 a most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. 31.000317637646805
 every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in albion’s history) placed on the finger of his blushing  fiancée an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. 34.69827804006665
 nay, even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel tomkin maxwell ffrenchmullan tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. 16.07629347155352
 with his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate  entourage,_ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:  god blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. 21.3096703945275
 blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when i sees her cause i thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down limehouse way. 11.48067030107343
 so then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak their own language and joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of joe and talking about the gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of ireland. 21.31851474928677
 antitreating is about the size of it. 2.5165293456670215
 gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint. 5.388470004256076
 and one night i went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my maureen lay and there was a fellow with a ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don’t be talking. 23.42670655834377
 ireland sober is ireland free. 3.5334069725931014
 and then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. 6.492933829150207
 and one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt. 9.589220087534999
 so howandever, as i was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by joe and me. 9.901413086027885
 i’d train him by kindness, so i would, if he was my dog. 4.051495775903515
 give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him. 7.129688254780715
  afraid he’ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering. 2.261517590063469
  no, says i. 1.1475252378556526
 but he might take my leg for a lamppost. 1.4524795645124207
 so he calls the old dog over. 1.5466422089576028
  what’s on you, garry? says he. 3.467840179039786
 then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. 9.53035698352604
 such growling you never heard as they let off between them. 3.7340921185870655
 someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter  pro bono  publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. 12.351292904740816
 growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws. 9.682637963185899
 all those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the  sobriquet of garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances owen garry. 14.137454083506
 the exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. 12.730171479211913
 our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a  striking resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient celtic bards. 15.762695144805095
 we are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the little sweet branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor d. 10.006481337003205
 points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous raftery and of donal macconsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. 14.78786877770054
 we subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into english by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. 7.781051108064724
 the metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. 18.899902159737547
 perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if owen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour. 8.429687987041902
 the curse of my curses seven days every day and seven dry thursdays on you, barney kiernan, has no sup of water to cool my courage, and my guts red roaring after lowry’s lights. 12.560961276017906
 so he told terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off. 6.984858066823208
 and joe asked him would he have another. 4.213702110677331
  i will, says he,  a  chara, to show there’s no ill feeling. 4.033885850609597
 gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking. 5.062165030761205
 arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old giltrap’s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. 9.941339148973755
 entertainment for man and beast. 3.0235726018091857
 and says joe:  could you make a hole in another pint?  could a swim duck? says i. 4.477131272447105
  same again, terry, says joe. 3.2191422178492015
 are you sure you won’t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he. 3.276520793482247
  thank you, no, says bloom. 2.5046194687284835
 as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet martin cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor dignam’s. 4.790977213165285
 martin asked me to go to the house. 2.572868320345753
 you see, he, dignam, i mean, didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy. 11.828821219406588
  holy wars, says joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old shylock is landed. 3.7144325579516297
 so the wife comes out top dog, what?  well, that’s a point, says bloom, for the wife’s admirers. 6.378022343322192
  whose admirers? says joe. 1.0980844461329513
  the wife’s advisers, i mean, says bloom. 2.751471290876182
 then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that dignam owed bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. 32.38427878684362
 he was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. 8.6246068217422
 selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal hungarian privileged lottery. 1.9894818281777369
 true as you’re there. 2.7173518753114507
 o, commend me to an israelite! royal and privileged hungarian robbery. 9.459322421704725
 so bob doran comes lurching around asking bloom to tell mrs dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little willy that’s dead to tell her. 20.208383009709962
 choking with bloody foolery. 1.7824757586417115
 and shaking bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that. 2.5948237311787086
 shake hands, brother. 1.3272675114672152
 you’re a rogue and i’m another. 1.838031090534567
  let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as i hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour. 17.728677396053858
 but, should i have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness. 9.901890014713732
  no, rejoined the other, i appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and i shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup. 24.76484500128366
  then suffer me to take your hand, said he. 1.623947940891012
 the goodness of your heart, i feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were i to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech. 18.24407739627606
 and off with him and out trying to walk straight. 4.186884977083229
 boosed at five o’clock. 2.172567325540074
 night he was near being lagged only paddy leonard knew the bobby, Numbera. 4.102808773182373
 blind to the world up in a shebeen in bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. 9.630414531267643
 and calling himself a frenchy for the shawls, joseph manuo, and talking against the catholic religion, and he serving mass in adam and eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. 16.060230380661196
 and the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. 9.979150409648526
  how is your testament? have you got an old testament?_ only paddy was passing there, i tell you what. 4.023553576268356
 then see him of a sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. 13.774237968818058
 jack mooney’s sister. 1.5517969087289996
 and the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. 10.49801543544891
 gob, jack made him toe the line. 3.7701347094751156
 told him if he didn’t patch up the pot, jesus, he’d kick the shite out of him. 3.276399950529072
 so terry brought the three pints. 1.9791581252925121
  here, says joe, doing the honours. 2.761205355866314
 here, citizen. 1.0143203297007048
 — slan  leat, says he. 2.7551357727522907
  fortune, joe, says i. 5.4559168592862655
 good health, citizen. 2.3223706193426854
 gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. 4.597620409307489
 want a small fortune to keep him in drinks. 3.026771436829731
  who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, alf? says joe. 4.979857057131445
  friend of yours, says alf. 1.5130433037756619
  nannan? says joe. 1.1468174265452082
 the mimber?  i won’t mention any names, says alf. 2.786288925062442
  i thought so, says joe. 1.8535656273492171
 i saw him up at that meeting now with william field, m. 2.8451638439373315
, the cattle traders. 1.0140774381949897
  hairy iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own. 14.855357948284398
 so joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. 10.498529565295025
 because he was up one time in a knacker’s yard. 3.277768739100711
 walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head and my heels are coming till joe cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier. 8.796547718811501
 mister knowall. 1.0
 teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. 3.54598195557111
 pisser burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with mrs o’dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her. 8.295995783063143
 couldn’t loosen her farting strings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. 5.54737045219668
 what’s your programme today? ay. 1.4578547951344822
 humane methods. 1.0
 because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. 8.432583130917738
 gob, he’d have a soft hand under a hen. 2.395362620694471
 ga ga gara. 3.1443665703282937
 klook klook klook. 2.0071873337304242
 black liz is our hen. 2.4511133774541896
 she lays eggs for us. 1.1100097744741786
 when she lays her egg she is so glad. 2.1316374469435617
 klook klook klook. 2.0071873337304242
 then comes good uncle leo. 2.455822980139168
 he puts his hand under black liz and takes her fresh egg. 4.545701991042442
 ga ga ga ga gara. 4.816941116233861
 klook klook klook. 2.0071873337304242
  anyhow, says joe, field and nannetti are going over tonight to london to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons. 5.430979805456598
  are you sure, says bloom, the councillor is going? i wanted to see him, as it happens. 5.3313584619868575
  well, he’s going off by the mailboat, says joe, tonight. 4.939034918627276
  that’s too bad, says bloom. 1.5431039243607654
 i wanted particularly. 1.0278359095007066
 perhaps only mr field is going. 2.2220661596471287

 mr cowe conacre (multifarnham. 7.366654919315592
): arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for shillelagh, may i ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition? mr allfours (tamoshant. 12.226775840621722
): honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. 4.300151735070198
 i feel i cannot usefully add anything to that. 4.977878947056433
 the answer to the honourable member’s question is in the affirmative. 4.951067097051507
 mr orelli o’reilly (montenotte. 7.366654919315592
): have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play irish games in the phoenix park? mr allfours: the answer is in the negative. 5.923189868978226
 mr cowe conacre: has the right honourable gentleman’s famous mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the treasury bench? (o! o!) mr allfours: i must have notice of that question. 12.984399555618555

) the speaker: order! order! (the house rises. 6.533935315533049
)  there’s the man, says joe, that made the gaelic sports revival. 4.011187059491132
 there he is sitting there. 1.826154673908672

 the champion of all ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. 4.715679102473608
 what was your best throw, citizen? — na  bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. 4.718713295605091
 there was a time i was as good as the next fellow anyhow. 4.425468697497312
  put it there, citizen, says joe. 2.904888067564373
 you were and a bloody sight better. 2.093699247461155
  is that really a fact? says alf. 2.0136225219011057
  yes, says bloom. 1.0618182803952245
 that’s well known. 1.5277378714454843
 did you not know that? so off they started about irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that. 16.461332717420394
 and of course bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart violent exercise was bad. 7.596009301043642
 i declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to bloom:  look at, bloom. 7.516584525688594

 declare to my aunt he’d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady. 6.011176075619828
 a most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of  brian o’ciarnain’ s in  sraid na bretaine  bheag, under the auspices of  sluagh na  h eireann, on the revival of ancient gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient greece and ancient rome and ancient ireland, for the development of the race. 17.109946106707948
 the venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. 7.7473598530653325
 after an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient panceltic forefathers. 15.870123446341154
 the wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, mr joseph m’carthy hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by finn maccool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. 19.076765176960638
 bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal thomas osborne davis’ evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here)  a nation once  again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. 27.89619130244241
 the irish caruso garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. 9.19355459988791
 his superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. 17.993887081458034

  talking about violent exercise, says alf, were you at that keogh bennett match?  no, says joe. 3.25263525016712

  who? blazes? says joe. 2.0913904608971037
 and says bloom:  what i meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye. 6.386157133506044
  ay, blazes, says alf. 2.2205654124434417
 he let out that myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time. 5.424774455224368
  we know him, says the citizen. 1.2385958764133203
 the traitor’s son. 3.127193774289859
 we know what put english gold in his pocket. 2.6790744681508456
  true for you, says joe. 1.733172259348666
 and bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking alf:  now, don’t you think, bergan?  myler dusted the floor with him, says alf. 8.344773067455398
 heenan and sayers was only a bloody fool to it. 3.9423601073409276

 see the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. 6.004199835521663
 god, he gave him one last puck in the wind, queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate. 11.041356467330404
 it was a historic and a hefty battle when myler and percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. 5.748232903450766
 handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, dublin’s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. 5.982338458415737
 the final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. 3.4961136682306457
 the welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet’s nose, and myler came on looking groggy. 14.067139900378184
 the soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of bennett’s jaw. 7.295813243434868
 the redcoat ducked but the dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. 5.9217528002455895
 the men came to handigrips. 2.4273032000131467
 myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, myler punishing him. 14.13050756396817
 the englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic eblanite in jigtime. 19.39146163659207
 it was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. 3.9393062414385156
 the two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. 2.6139456715911935
 the referee twice cautioned pucking percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. 12.094562541913886
 after a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to battling bennett’s stomach, flooring him flat. 10.973829034567293
 it was a knockout clean and clever. 2.6778787523623886
 amid tense expectation the portobello bruiser was being counted out when bennett’s second ole pfotts wettstein threw in the towel and the santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight. 15.474229664213954
  he knows which side his bread is buttered, says alf. 3.1452194984436512

 tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he’ll dissolve in tears on the bench. 10.351092082298509
  ay, says alf. 1.0294050560086818
 reuben j was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little gumley that’s minding stones, for the corporation there near butt bridge. 9.201452582871006
 and he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:  a most scandalous thing! this poor hardworking man! how many children? ten, did you say?  yes, your worship. 6.88232166524207
 and my wife has the typhoid. 1.695098852127126
  and the wife with typhoid fever! scandalous! leave the court immediately, sir. 5.656966443279764
 no, sir, i’ll make no order for payment. 2.34536262132702
 how dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! a poor hardworking industrious man! i dismiss the case. 9.161849912057212
 and whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the holy and undivided trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. 21.332658257012277
 there master courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master justice andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition  in  re the real and personal estate of the late lamented jacob halliday, vintner, deceased, versus livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. 34.857049451314296
 and to the solemn court of green street there came sir frederick the falconer. 4.504657233329055
 and he sat him there about the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of dublin. 16.631210234707204
 and there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of patrick and of the tribe of hugh and of the tribe of owen and of the tribe of conn and of the tribe of oscar and of the tribe of fergus and of the tribe of finn and of the tribe of dermot and of the tribe of cormac and of the tribe of kevin and of the tribe of caolte and of the tribe of ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. 53.963277006046056
 and he conjured them by him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them god and kiss the book. 21.43624961363291
 and they rose in their seats, those twelve of iar, and they swore by the name of him who is from everlasting that they would do his rightwiseness. 6.506479223896117
 and straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. 14.55950726859189
 and they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor. 15.3546004356201
  those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to ireland filling the country with bugs. 6.143300819802119
 so bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with joe, telling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to mr crawford. 12.736564250625577
 and so joe swore high and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all. 8.842329877143777
  because, you see, says bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. 5.630406745451772
 that’s the whole secret. 1.3414063719662743
  rely on me, says joe. 1.3552610464614814

 we want no more strangers in our house. 1.2918951969428922
  o, i’m sure that will be all right, hynes, says bloom. 3.232625465820688
 it’s just that keyes, you see. 1.8486185245436835
  consider that done, says joe. 2.069611182517406
  very kind of you, says bloom. 1.9191680764003514
  the strangers, says the citizen. 1.951887654305249
 our own fault. 1.3472106945260496
 we let them come in. 1.9140845026674864
 we brought them in. 1.4821242156017091
 the adulteress and her paramour brought the saxon robbers here. 5.970533391826513

 and bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider’s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when. 10.425088826741952
  a dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that’s what’s the cause of all our misfortunes. 4.497303418541383
  and here she is, says alf, that was giggling over the  police  gazette with terry on the counter, in all her warpaint. 8.253883988405343
  give us a squint at her, says i. 1.8990605921086745

 get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what? so anyhow in came john wyse nolan and lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast. 10.550456625445577
  well, says the citizen, what’s the latest from the scene of action? what did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the irish language? o’nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided gael. 43.73131069504658
  it’s on the march, says the citizen. 2.3594627630140295
 to hell with the bloody brutal sassenachs and their  patois. 3.2156823210170398
_ so j. 1.7527911643330791
 puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation. 25.523303472222512
  their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. 2.6940218268143887
 to hell with them! the curse of a goodfornothing god light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores’ gets! no music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. 11.110780602119616
 any civilisation they have they stole from us. 2.1198238871056945

  they’re not european, says the citizen. 1.2720325133443318
 i was in europe with kevin egan of paris. 1.596408017064672
 you wouldn’t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in europe except in a  cabinet d’aisance. 3.7751305741008974
_ and says john wyse:  full many a flower is born to blush unseen. 3.310377025511995
 and says lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo: — conspuez les anglais! perfide albion!_ he said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan  lamh dearg  abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods. 30.452878059109825
  what’s up with you, says i to lenehan. 11.143528273443076
 you look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner. 3.817820296478158
  gold cup, says he. 1.7087899969401477
  who won, mr lenehan? says terry. 6.805258177515633
 _ throwaway,_ says he, at twenty to one. 3.30812466217874
 a rank outsider. 2.775731045538683
 and the rest nowhere. 1.0457464951383637

 takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. 3.053967339600787
 frailty, thy name is  sceptre. 2.7167054973990545

 old mother hubbard went to the cupboard. 3.5654591626838643

 there’s no one as blind as the fellow that won’t see, if you know what that means. 4.539074136621279
 where are our missing twenty millions of irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? and our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! and our wool that was sold in rome in the time of juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of antrim and our limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by ballybough and our huguenot poplin that we have since jacquard de lyon and our woven silk and our foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the carmelite convent in new ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. 30.26843491590219
 where are the greek merchants that came through the pillars of hercules, the gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and tyrian purple to sell in wexford at the fair of carmen? read tacitus and ptolemy, even giraldus cambrensis. 15.072934487555493
 wine, peltries, connemara marble, silver from tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the irish hobbies, with king philip of spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. 14.73226358651291
 what do the yellowjohns of anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? and the beds of the barrow and shannon they won’t deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?  as treeless as portugal we’ll be soon, says john wyse, or heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. 16.63163821049922
 larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. 4.798974511701017
 i was reading a report of lord castletown’s. 2.2558888294630655

 the fashionable international world attended  en  masse this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier jean wyse de neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the irish national foresters, with miss fir conifer of pine valley. 21.75237011131345

 the bride who was given away by her father, the m’conifer of the glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. 19.430365025475073
 the maids of honour, miss larch conifer and miss spruce conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty  motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral. 19.245957400020163
 senhor enrique flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of  woodman, spare that  tree at the conclusion of the service. 17.70228917467683
 on leaving the church of saint fiacre  in  horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. 17.705179368354973
 mr and mrs wyse conifer neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the black forest. 4.3163076564707605
  and our eyes are on europe, says the citizen. 1.90705349820085
 we had our trade with spain and the french and with the flemings before those mongrels were pupped, spanish ale in galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway. 9.012788882704097
  and will again, says joe. 1.653307654686726
  and with the help of the holy mother of god we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh. 4.8794540073899375
 our harbours that are empty will be full again, queenstown, kinsale, galway, blacksod bay, ventry in the kingdom of kerry, killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the galway lynches and the cavan o’reillys and the o’kennedys of dublin when the earl of desmond could make a treaty with the emperor charles the fifth himself. 25.152298844382315
 and will again, says he, when the first irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your henry tudor’s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of desmond and thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of milesius. 17.799425016559482
 and he took the last swig out of the pint. 3.035662695975077
 all wind and piss like a tanyard cat. 5.3941202434992155
 cows in connacht have long horns. 2.431782057387954
 as much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the molly maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant. 16.13622711421443
  hear, hear to that, says john wyse. 7.902968389158906
 what will you have?  an imperial yeomanry, says lenehan, to celebrate the occasion. 3.9835318244358433

  but what about the fighting navy, says ned, that keeps our foes at bay?  i’ll tell you what about it, says the citizen. 4.6429049777889935
 hell upon earth it is. 2.4603301506196313
 read the revelations that’s going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at portsmouth. 7.567751101786247
 a fellow writes that calls himself  disgusted  one. 3.910201668047154
 so he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun. 12.276271651872545
  a rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir john beresford called it but the modern god’s englishman calls it caning on the breech. 7.156928664253524
 and says john wyse: —’tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance. 4.852851702527544
 then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder. 9.159671260257676
  that’s your glorious british navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth. 2.945255590162629
 the fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of god’s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. 9.00891581366874
 that’s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs. 3.3944158067278245
  on which the sun never rises, says joe. 2.4197010716625376
  and the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. 3.540710851884671
 the unfortunate yahoos believe it. 1.7744197264878598
 they believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in jacky tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid. 22.459482019227256
  but, says bloom, isn’t discipline the same everywhere. 5.036495555869419
 i mean wouldn’t it be the same here if you put force against force? didn’t i tell you? as true as i’m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living. 14.771913140482694
  we’ll put force against force, says the citizen. 1.7344174173527556
 we have our greater ireland beyond the sea. 1.2734723771970158
 they were driven out of house and home in the black Number. 5.9326236710995035
 their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the  times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered saxons there would soon be as few irish in ireland as redskins in america. 13.545999086446356
 even the grand turk sent us his piastres. 4.117405014989677
 but the sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the british hyenas bought and sold in rio de janeiro. 9.684787301560574
 ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. 1.8410575554952948
 twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships. 3.3665657173989367
 but those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage. 5.196913266497247
 and they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of granuaile, the champions of kathleen ni houlihan. 9.512128455575459
  perfectly true, says bloom. 1.228035361886782
 but my point was. 1.219589692932719
  we are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says ned. 3.149880067461921
 since the poor old woman told us that the french were on the sea and landed at killala. 4.455374081289298
  ay, says john wyse. 1.0277729682337138
 we fought for the royal stuarts that reneged us against the williamites and they betrayed us. 6.324703871491385
 remember limerick and the broken treatystone. 2.854599964231607
 we gave our best blood to france and spain, the wild geese. 2.1593308691009154
 fontenoy, eh? and sarsfield and o’donnell, duke of tetuan in spain, and ulysses browne of camus that was fieldmarshal to maria teresa. 9.9881634872127
 but what did we ever get for it?  the french! says the citizen. 4.270801202887013
 set of dancing masters! do you know what it is? they were never worth a roasted fart to ireland. 6.012105188342289
 aren’t they trying to make an  entente  cordiale now at tay pay’s dinnerparty with perfidious albion? firebrands of europe and they always were. 8.012150961064542
 — conspuez les  français, says lenehan, nobbling his beer. 3.8343901309983615
  and as for the prooshians and the hanoverians, says joe, haven’t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from george the elector down to the german lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s dead? jesus, i had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of god, old vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about  ehren on the  rhine and come where the boose is cheaper. 38.49419513874519

  tell that to a fool, says the citizen. 2.369930041865792
 there’s a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo. 5.237912306266286
 edward guelph wettin!  and what do you think, says joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of ireland doing up his room in maynooth in his satanic majesty’s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. 14.819396476677065
 the earl of dublin, no less. 1.477313930101056
  they ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little alf. 3.6930960812703515
 and says j. 1.1702504902017365
:  considerations of space influenced their lordships’ decision. 8.194029556933366
  will you try another, citizen? says joe. 2.900043155642623
  yes, sir, says he. 2.2702281750253435
 i will. 1.0
  you? says joe. 1.10656615277759
  beholden to you, joe, says i. 5.324006744436939
 may your shadow never grow less. 2.8005176794585247
  repeat that dose, says joe. 3.26644853681044
 bloom was talking and talking with john wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about. 10.901992034457898
  persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it. 5.018474140783754
 perpetuating national hatred among nations. 2.11740638005886
  but do you know what a nation means? says john wyse. 2.095150773688645
  yes, says bloom. 1.0618182803952245
  what is it? says john wyse. 1.2692860161174069
  a nation? says bloom. 1.1270723523580244
 a nation is the same people living in the same place. 2.637044083355632
  by god, then, says ned, laughing, if that’s so i’m a nation for i’m living in the same place for the past five years. 7.856532808665431
 so of course everyone had the laugh at bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:  or also living in different places. 7.123657989803631
  that covers my case, says joe. 3.115477497464088
  what is your nation if i may ask? says the citizen. 2.39417820704427
  ireland, says bloom. 1.1870346568709857
 i was born here. 1.3762781536155588
 the citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a red bank oyster out of him right in the corner. 8.420756956087518
  after you with the push, joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry. 6.478907015375239
  here you are, citizen, says joe. 3.5995948554808948
 take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words. 5.116029551264491
 the muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient irish facecloth attributed to solomon of droma and manus tomaltach og macdonogh, authors of the book of ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration. 15.146845440570317
 no need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a north american puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the british article, be it said in passing), a kerry calf and a golden eagle from carrantuohill. 32.03453989215096
 the scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the barmecides. 23.441344672516628
 glendalough, the lovely lakes of killarney, the ruins of clonmacnois, cong abbey, glen inagh and the twelve pins, ireland’s eye, the green hills of tallaght, croagh patrick, the brewery of messrs arthur guinness, son and company (limited), lough neagh’s banks, the vale of ovoca, isolde’s tower, the mapas obelisk, sir patrick dun’s hospital, cape clear, the glen of aherlow, lynch’s castle, the scotch house, rathdown union workhouse at loughlinstown, tullamore jail, castleconnel rapids, kilballymacshonakill, the cross at monasterboice, jury’s hotel, s. 49.56007725564153
 patrick’s purgatory, the salmon leap, maynooth college refectory, curley’s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of wellington, the rock of cashel, the bog of allen, the henry street warehouse, fingal’s cave all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time. 19.933996121283165
  show us over the drink, says i. 2.0251628217842685
 which is which?  that’s mine, says joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman. 5.858438653878844
  and i belong to a race too, says bloom, that is hated and persecuted. 5.288132559091427
 also now. 1.0
 this very moment. 1.3297218265668345
 this very instant. 2.581877514659741
 gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar. 3.329071222558145
  robbed, says he. 1.1303906110300364
 taking what belongs to us by right. 8.91107712332474
 at this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in morocco like slaves or cattle. 3.891537673933799
  are you talking about the new jerusalem? says the citizen. 1.7092931183158742
  i’m talking about injustice, says bloom. 1.70877250278801
  right, says john wyse. 1.6346939073656452
 stand up to it then with force like men. 3.402667681420853
 that’s an almanac picture for you. 1.3064434479740457
 mark for a softnosed bullet. 2.2890631552716023
 old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. 4.7296235759295255
 gob, he’d adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse’s apron on him. 8.276642696139575
 and then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag. 5.447927194646122
  but it’s no use, says he. 2.1554936225606505
 force, hatred, history, all that. 5.363258240535313
 that’s not life for men and women, insult and hatred. 5.369076979823038
 and everybody knows that it’s the very opposite of that that is really life. 5.88060163954533
  what? says alf. 1.0317990917468312
  love, says bloom. 2.747848503853779
 i mean the opposite of hatred. 2.730289859782745
 i must go now, says he to john wyse. 5.273503541091339
 just round to the court a moment to see if martin is there. 3.376444658829365
 if he comes just say i’ll be back in a second. 2.917820207577443
 just a moment. 1.0212761987906955
 who’s hindering you? and off he pops like greased lightning. 12.26376689103265
  a new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. 2.2587214730672462
 universal love. 1.0
  well, says john wyse. 1.118830730767569
 isn’t that what we’re told. 3.7274737508899145
 love your neighbour. 2.96725733644443
  that chap? says the citizen. 1.44095711921739
 beggar my neighbour is his motto. 1.9181108060620489

 you love a certain person. 1.9409621977168656
 and this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but god loves everybody. 5.462770817244038
  well, joe, says i, your very good health and song. 5.766275090525316
 more power, citizen. 1.4501883894790428
  hurrah, there, says joe. 2.2428170925062036
  the blessing of god and mary and patrick on you, says the citizen. 3.8455667917404788
 and he ups with his pint to wet his whistle. 4.576222586296199
  we know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. 4.230655334229311
 what about sanctimonious cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of drogheda to the sword with the bible text  god is  love pasted round the mouth of his cannon? the bible! did you read that skit in the  united  irishman today about that zulu chief that’s visiting england?  what’s that? says joe. 22.884355924124023
 so the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out:  a delegation of the chief cotton magnates of manchester was presented yesterday to his majesty the alaki of abeakuta by gold stick in waiting, lord walkup of walkup on eggs, to tender to his majesty the heartfelt thanks of british traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. 20.96355764721161
 the delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the british chaplain, the reverend ananias praisegod barebones, tendered his best thanks to massa walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between abeakuta and the british empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of god and the secret of england’s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the royal donor. 39.91148408689382
 the alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast  black and  white from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty kakachakachak, surnamed forty warts, after which he visited the chief factory of cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently executing a charming old abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands. 30.651879648964794
  widow woman, says ned. 1.2619084611301412
 i wouldn’t doubt her. 1.2387582176825123
 wonder did he put that bible to the same use as i would. 3.1027275120587094
  same only more so, says lenehan. 2.8094583478720723
 and thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly. 15.780495597730201
  is that by griffith? says john wyse. 2.269578456326287
  no, says the citizen. 1.1497982970020997
 it’s not signed shanganagh. 2.8550915221995985
 it’s only initialled: p. 2.487680226635068
  and a very good initial too, says joe. 2.8113799718805765
  that’s how it’s worked, says the citizen. 2.252691928049895
 trade follows the flag. 4.032494550738351
  well, says j. 1.102241586195971
, if they’re any worse than those belgians in the congo free state they must be bad. 3.861577317256802
 did you read that report by a man what’s this his name is?  casement, says the citizen. 5.877144097554534
 he’s an irishman. 1.0141124712239236
  yes, that’s the man, says j. 2.5549602354696064
 raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them. 13.835690824516778
  i know where he’s gone, says lenehan, cracking his fingers. 1.7245417043834297
  who? says i. 1.0885178014251276
  bloom, says he. 1.184523938302501
 the courthouse is a blind. 1.5834563424658812
 he had a few bob on  throwaway and he’s gone to gather in the shekels. 3.2028769406867426
  is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?  that’s where he’s gone, says lenehan. 8.345498372106247
 i met bantam lyons going to back that horse only i put him off it and he told me bloom gave him the tip. 6.9977899283445275
 bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. 3.7002485674705867
 he’s the only man in dublin has it. 3.0727682946859356
 a dark horse. 1.2967090409368067
  he’s a bloody dark horse himself, says joe. 2.309663627902027
  mind, joe, says i. 5.6866878216959575
 show us the entrance out. 1.3176648848665031
  there you are, says terry. 1.9319291367219062
 goodbye ireland i’m going to gort. 1.4076249382319928
 so i just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while i was letting off my _( throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says i to myself i knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of joe and one in slattery’s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube  she’s  better or  she’ s (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (jesus, full up i was) trading without a licence (ow!) ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there’s the last of it) jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos. 60.88704635246512
 so anyhow when i got back they were at it dingdong, john wyse saying it was bloom gave the ideas for sinn fein to griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling irish industries. 12.939125730278185
 robbing peter to pay paul. 1.5362471121774592
 gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. 8.048604478141414
 give us a bloody chance. 1.1737621136618577
 god save ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout. 3.311454638932566
 mr bloom with his argol bargol. 2.3644388345217027
 and his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old methusalem bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds. 16.787326761296974
 loans by post on easy terms. 1.726025579165643
 any amount of money advanced on note of hand. 5.139108819321069
 distance no object. 1.2113427114925106
 no security. 1.0
 gob, he’s like lanty machale’s goat that’d go a piece of the road with every one. 5.672218389524394
  well, it’s a fact, says john wyse. 2.107538759499295
 and there’s the man now that’ll tell you all about it, martin cunningham. 2.887503994815989
 sure enough the castle car drove up with martin on it and jack power with him and a fellow named crofter or crofton, pensioner out of the collector general’s, an orangeman blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or crawford gallivanting around the country at the king’s expense. 15.623522683120438
 our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys. 6.865600129902224
  ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. 7.892194341534523
 saucy knave! to us! so saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice. 6.921291884105557
 mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard. 3.7687713555281404
  give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow. 4.689126610137039
  bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. 3.869974508584064
 look to our steeds. 1.4453568211903878
 and for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it. 7.977994041834789
  lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder. 7.362630486883176
 i know not what to offer your lordships. 5.040466599422306
  how now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, so servest thou the king’s messengers, master taptun? an instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage. 18.685567739651542
  cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. 5.9243491863218996
 an you be the king’s messengers (god shield his majesty!) you shall not want for aught. 10.410468960217266
 the king’s friends (god bless his majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house i warrant me. 7.322494838983269
  then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect. 5.62504914904506
 hast aught to give us? mine host bowed again as he made answer:  what say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon, a boar’s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old rhenish?  gadzooks! cried the last speaker. 24.09765906544638
 that likes me well. 1.1185724144946387
 pistachios!  aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. 6.229710240468168
 a poor house and a bare larder, quotha! ’tis a merry rogue. 5.264570057657922
 so in comes martin asking where was bloom. 12.65583557096375
  where is he? says lenehan. 1.5422376329564011
 defrauding widows and orphans. 1.31604675625326
  isn’t that a fact, says john wyse, what i was telling the citizen about bloom and the sinn fein?  that’s so, says martin. 6.64462395291282
 or so they allege. 1.511502966706109
  who made those allegations? says alf. 1.8460370712865308
  i, says joe. 1.3054788181257466
 i’m the alligator. 1.0323436057988624
  and after all, says john wyse, why can’t a jew love his country like the next fellow?  why not? says j. 8.423012990530314
, when he’s quite sure which country it is. 2.8947020866210567
  is he a jew or a gentile or a holy roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he? says ned. 6.976042077888862
 or who is he? no offence, crofton. 2.6083187505391034
  who is junius? says j. 2.1205727211559364
  we don’t want him, says crofter the orangeman or presbyterian. 3.742920919638587
  he’s a perverted jew, says martin, from a place in hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the hungarian system. 7.918991074094199
 we know that in the castle. 1.3609470877201426
  isn’t he a cousin of bloom the dentist? says jack power. 6.790204468328516
  not at all, says martin. 1.7404988374516803
 only namesakes. 1.0
 his name was virag, the father’s name that poisoned himself. 2.800083352780526
 he changed it by deedpoll, the father did. 6.597161840077051
  that’s the new messiah for ireland! says the citizen. 2.043974211176486
 island of saints and sages!  well, they’re still waiting for their redeemer, says martin. 4.731681000935976
 for that matter so are we. 2.6603177238731277
  yes, says j. 1.0391356826011275
, and every male that’s born they think it may be their messiah. 4.310686693930936
 and every jew is in a tall state of excitement, i believe, till he knows if he’s a father or a mother. 4.448337061040187
  expecting every moment will be his next, says lenehan. 3.363906659485324
  o, by god, says ned, you should have seen bloom before that son of his that died was born. 6.193247322257286
 i met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of neave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered. 5.760519627293059
 — en ventre sa  mère, says j. 2.605635260313623
  do you call that a man? says the citizen. 2.6440952601194776
  i wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says joe. 2.387843686840718
  well, there were two children born anyhow, says jack power. 3.645620679333231
  and who does he suspect? says the citizen. 4.280270834369305
 gob, there’s many a true word spoken in jest. 2.9376565135840815
 one of those mixed middlings he is. 1.9319558528760887
 lying up in the hotel pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses. 5.092532272043926
 do you know what i’m telling you? it’d be an act of god to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea. 9.944289057680304
 justifiable homicide, so it would. 2.5728341668395056
 then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man. 2.6492306278481075
 give us your blessing. 1.4360794519895055

 the milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. 15.63777763811413
 a many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. 28.502684678308064

 a large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to nagyaságos uram lipóti virag, late of messrs alexander thom’s, printers to his majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of százharminczbrojúgulyás dugulás (meadow of murmuring waters). 15.797963781026533
 the ceremony which went off with great  éclat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. 6.641389731194082
 an illuminated scroll of ancient irish vellum, the work of irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, messrs jacob  agus jacob. 20.26839433583687
 the departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of  come back to  erin, followed immediately by  rakóczsy’s  march. 14.124558196202118
 tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the hill of howth, three rock mountain, sugarloaf, bray head, the mountains of mourne, the galtees, the ox and donegal and sperrin peaks, the nagles and the bograghs, the connemara hills, the reeks of m’gillicuddy, slieve aughty, slieve bernagh and slieve bloom. 23.58475542350122
 amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant cambrian and caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the ballast office and custom house were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the pigeonhouse and the poolbeg light. 29.52183273871435
  visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! visszontlátásra!_ gone but not forgotten. 5.670051665196967
 gob, the devil wouldn’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the queen’s royal theatre:  where is he till i murder him? and ned and j. 12.570536121809125
 paralysed with the laughing. 1.2127673513462836
  bloody wars, says i, i’ll be in for the last gospel. 3.075065303583325
 but as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag’s head round the other way and off with him. 7.789994683527851
  hold on, citizen, says joe. 3.5810241506611944

 gob, he near sent it into the county longford. 3.229652923945342
 the bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street. 12.508423738720987
 the catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. 2.2720749619510134
 the observatory of dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of mercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of Number, the year of the rebellion of silken thomas. 14.525169081992715
 the epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the inn’s quay ward and parish of saint michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. 10.431983895210907
 all the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. 20.192082920280665
 from the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. 11.073815502514817
 an article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace mr george fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir frederick falkiner, recorder of dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant’s causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of holeopen bay near the old head of kinsale. 38.63500089514079
 other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. 14.730591572501622
 messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special  missa pro  defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the holy see in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. 22.797914002422456

 the jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as god made moses. 2.3368928854873183
 what? o, jesus, he did. 2.7878817927554556
 and he let a volley of oaths after him. 2.3087133769376877
  did i kill him, says he, or what? and he shouting to the bloody dog:  after him, garry! after him, boy! and the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb. 19.396927652754748

 when, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein he stood ascend to heaven. 7.577222342386225
 and they beheld him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon him. 12.32372161610387
 and there came a voice out of heaven, calling:  elijah! elijah!_ and he answered with a main cry:  abba! adonai!_ and they beheld him even him, ben bloom elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over donohoe’s in little green street like a shot off a shovel. 15.402413502440004
 the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace. 3.120475192973724
 far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, mary, star of the sea. 38.78379591926177
 the three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. 4.549804673306565
 many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, cissy caffrey and edy boardman with the baby in the pushcar and tommy and jacky caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name  h. 16.851070351436558
  belleisle printed on both. 1.4550550159649966
 for tommy and jacky caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. 8.754531778801413
 they were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. 10.383816865601105
 and edy boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. 6.783804461521916
 he was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. 9.899723644454271
 cissy caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin. 4.874068148234857
  now, baby, cissy caffrey said. 2.9191770144220097
 say out big, big. 5.882460849918695
 i want a drink of water. 1.4760004876908115
 and baby prattled after her:  a jink a jink a jawbo. 8.960896756601079
 cissy caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and tommy caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was cissy caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on. 13.184855427686754
 what a persuasive power that girl had! but to be sure baby boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib. 10.541446635821032
 none of your spoilt beauties, flora macflimsy sort, was cissy caffrey. 8.013563130898985
 a truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. 14.699904436994023
 and edy boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother. 3.1839898687452437
 but just then there was a slight altercation between master tommy and master jacky. 3.750798804190126
 boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule. 3.624122475831626
 the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the martello tower had. 11.832124030861541
 but if master tommy was headstrong master jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little irishman’s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too. 21.619920587581074
 needless to say the cries of discomfited master tommy drew the attention of the girl friends. 3.7703833488415457
  come here, tommy, his sister called imperatively. 5.070544279087736
 at once! and you, jacky, for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand. 5.662991889586482
 wait till i catch you for that. 1.8820590437858393
 his eyes misty with unshed tears master tommy came at her call for their big sister’s word was law with the twins. 7.403412998892599
 and in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure. 5.555344689187599
 his little man o’ war top and unmentionables were full of sand but cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit. 8.58760285795312
 still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at master jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition. 14.622117712031102
  nasty bold jacky! she cried. 1.6655871762197223
 she put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:  what’s your name? butter and cream?  tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke edy boardman. 6.851051852274915
 is cissy your sweetheart?  nao, tearful tommy said. 2.836626441073399
  is edy boardman your sweetheart? cissy queried. 2.9377943829224678
  nao, tommy said. 2.35188955253045
  i know, edy boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes. 3.0790758405755545
 i know who is tommy’s sweetheart. 1.5935834414408894
 gerty is tommy’s sweetheart. 1.9156725905618182
  nao, tommy said on the verge of tears. 3.0289131305746646
 cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to edy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes. 8.831538909831528
 but who was gerty? gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see. 11.305892425594651
 she was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a giltrap than a macdowell. 18.251465121256796
 her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the widow welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling. 15.197940789464635
 the waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine cupid’s bow, greekly perfect. 12.736784645222624
 her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either. 12.299932052423111
 bertha supple told that once to edy boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again. 22.75330425153214
 honour where honour is due. 1.7916244901752516
 there was an innate refinement, a languid queenly  hauteur about gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep. 10.434159316670385
 had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education gerty macdowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her. 23.216512850136326
 mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist. 18.496195812732118
 why have women such eyes of witchery? gerty’s were of the bluest irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows. 10.79006460604814
 time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. 4.805200468794682
 it was madame vera verity, directress of the woman beautiful page of the princess novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it. 16.04232443586996
 then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? that would suit mrs dignam because she had a button one. 7.599658804621521
 but gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair. 4.082223063293454
 it was dark brown with a natural wave in it. 3.8821909608366876
 she had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, thursday for wealth. 9.854057716677035
 and just now at edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety god’s fair land of ireland did not hold her equal. 13.551017721703332
 for an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. 2.4871600243995178
 she was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. 5.519472319496344
 inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. 8.034684849151972
 the pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young may morning. 10.054834143055285
 she knew right well, no one better, what made squinty edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers’ quarrel. 11.905000541905407
 as per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window. 6.59430653884785
 only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother w. 11.688333167893388
 wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in trinity college university. 1.8602167394575466
 little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core. 9.879535766013722
 yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time. 3.9792467461781627
 they were protestants in his family and of course gerty knew who came first and after him the blessed virgin and then saint joseph. 5.067931483211306
 but he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why edy boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden. 24.920569635702126
 gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of dame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out. 8.622037654746117
 a neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the  lady’s  pictorial that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection. 17.871589418188723
 she wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. 14.03070093889201
 all tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. 10.655277846244577
 she did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! and when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew. 14.808283737045716
 her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (edy boardman prided herself that she was very  petite but she never had a foot like gerty macdowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep. 26.33827219751217
 her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops. 10.863734685619718
 as for undies they were gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? she had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things. 29.46203234558704
 she was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a friday. 31.001457620998572
 and yet and yet! that strained look on her face! a gnawing sorrow is there all the time. 7.3155651770575085
 her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror. 9.80706644946864
 you are lovely, gerty, it said. 3.1446908446259654
 the paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. 10.77079050933879
 gerty macdowell yearns in vain. 1.8743934115533216
 yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for mrs reggy wylie t. 6.488062134043179
 (because the one who married the elder brother would be mrs wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence mrs gertrude wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be. 10.995858793884247
 he was too young to understand. 2.936851747728473
 he would not believe in love, a woman’s birthright. 2.188320792754324
 the night of the party long ago in stoer’s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips. 6.764650360398091
 he called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments. 10.141904308914144
 impetuous fellow! strength of character had never been reggy wylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win gerty macdowell must be a man among men. 7.139540465734601
 but waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. 5.408537157896327
 no prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss. 16.996772686387235
 it would be like heaven. 1.3421304628200774
 for such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve. 4.8695512872261055
 with all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward. 22.096959038117806
 and while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be. 7.1286746767423645
 then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, bertha supple too, and edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in november. 7.761594864600466
 she would care for him with creature comforts too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess. 8.436983057404788
 her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa giltrap’s lovely dog garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses. 33.34630725997298
 he would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes. 21.148623326148
 edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight. 14.649503279517223
 but tommy said he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please. 11.47657621073886
 the temper of him! o, he was a man already was little tommy caffrey since he was out of pinnies. 6.508106124099495
 edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him. 8.818271175073399
  you’re not my sister, naughty tommy said. 2.2129968967846803
 it’s my ball. 1.0594507216443112
 but cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and tommy after it in full career, having won the day. 8.661366540778328
  anything for a quiet life, laughed ciss. 2.009104833318604
 and she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin. 9.077404671134303
 but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him. 5.127048169339781
  i’d like to give him something, she said, so i would, where i won’t say. 5.806975619542818
  on the beeoteetom, laughed cissy merrily. 4.915548957914135
 gerty macdowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and edy boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. 12.13712870899179
 but not a pin cared ciss. 1.270815388987038
  let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose. 4.542932597857682
 give it to him too on the same place as quick as i’d look at him. 3.8605935365041204
 madcap ciss with her golliwog curls. 1.6126165011618927
 you had to laugh at her sometimes. 2.18377044528867
 for instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white. 12.886908826649588
 that was just like cissycums. 1.4038333412805781
 o, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. 5.88631121882016
 there was none to come up to her for fun. 2.674537334929818
 but she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome. 11.118970936253202
 and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ. 6.11048484688777
 it was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend john hughes s. 2.679244010441434
, rosary, sermon and benediction of the most blessed sacrament. 2.1645699077408667
 they were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of our lady of loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy mary, holy virgin of virgins. 22.278858944447403
 how sad to poor gerty’s ears! had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in pearson’s weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none. 16.298805321489066
 over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. 13.144325995307748
 but that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days. 5.7570637055630955
 nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low. 19.988793904993226
 and still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful, virgin most merciful. 9.188624793514531
 and gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off sandymount green that cissy caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk. 15.457858526261438
 you never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of doctor fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. 18.388369384646587
 poor father! with all his faults she loved him still when he sang  tell me, mary, how to woo  thee or  my love and cottage near  rochelle and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang  the moon hath  raised with mr dignam that died suddenly and was buried, god have mercy on him, from a stroke. 18.5109825852312
 her mother’s birthday that was and charley was home on his holidays and tom and mr dignam and mrs and patsy and freddy dignam and they were to have had a group taken. 11.820971612923174
 no one would have thought the end was so near. 3.022456568879026
 now he was laid to rest. 2.052492867643749
 and her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about catesby’s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home. 22.737912689263787
 a sterling good daughter was gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold. 8.660432770163995
 and when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff. 14.479291729304432
 everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways. 3.328206900357558
 it was gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime mr tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window. 19.036220559377895
 you could see there was a story behind it. 1.3987849104573695
 the colours were done something lovely. 2.3732678530056286
 she was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. 9.592224462828442
 she often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant. 15.15347358290676
 the twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last master jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks. 10.027700724501255
 needless to say poor tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball. 14.805787848691066
 our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please. 9.004656243315678
 the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock. 8.80958525627559
 the twins clamoured again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and edy and cissy laughed. 13.42783600480797
  if you fail try again, edy boardman said. 3.662409307222377
 gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. 3.1858831599458304
 a delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle. 10.200141774955402
 pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. 3.847047962060503
 she felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with gerty macdowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks. 5.840833068837576
 till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen. 20.066455981441585
 through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. 12.441608186612827
 and careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told them what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary, the most pious virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her. 23.275295661624828
 the twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers. 7.048630532855159
 cissy caffrey played with baby boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. 4.287973355999546
 peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was cissy gone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn’t the little chap enjoy that! and then she told him to say papa. 12.859756400153078
  say papa, baby. 1.8224129878847768
 say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa. 18.299971598466403
 and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said. 9.73520639633776
  haja ja ja haja. 3.1800695582416947
 cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him. 13.518903262399279
 of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:  habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa. 9.994850505017338
 and two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. 4.970809084039139
 it was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased. 18.53418363647302
 gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins. 10.299210983790028
 she gazed out towards the distant sea. 1.6027614637153405
 it was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft. 16.534998656065298
 and while she gazed her heart went pitapat. 3.940799245215554
 yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look. 7.41454314023463
 his eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul. 6.33350506830223
 wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them? people were so queer. 6.557653188624421
 she could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of martin harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like winny rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly  retroussé from where he was sitting. 26.242731450014087
 he was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face. 4.9663913136941495
 she would have given worlds to know what it was. 1.591001176235396
 he was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. 6.8779765157358
 she was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking reggy wylie might be out but that was far away. 5.5361129956502095
 here was that of which she had so often dreamed. 3.7847551109018855
 it was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no one else. 7.365764788119601
 the very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. 8.975489153723158
 if he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. 8.57441830280232
 even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her. 3.562103343864429
 there were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. 6.514062604738514
 she was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past. 16.416374670176157
 then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone. 14.757509583386819
 refuge of sinners. 1.0653875525004788
 comfortress of the afflicted. 1.1540492401077702
  ora pro  nobis. 1.0017578575637216
 well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart. 17.71220064973332
 gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed virgin’s sodality and father conroy was helping canon o’hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down. 13.323654770432814
 he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of saint dominic. 11.10203834101098
 he told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by god, he said, and that our blessed lady herself said to the archangel gabriel be it done unto me according to thy word. 24.244451531907526
 he was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or some place. 27.718475584080732
 the exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. 4.8900195141749085
 little monkeys common as ditchwater. 2.617981000769177
 someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them. 5.206227230833436
 and cissy and edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned. 6.361860249277465
  jacky! tommy! not they! what a great notion they had! so cissy said it was the very last time she’d ever bring them out. 8.336947147103245
 she jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it. 15.613359369355448
 she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. 26.192386409961156
 it would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked french heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble. 9.769412255018784
  tableau!_ that would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness. 4.986991915587303
 queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then father conroy handed the thurible to canon o’hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed sacrament and cissy caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then canon o’hanlon handed the thurible back to father conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing the  tantum  ergo and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the  tantumer gosa cramen  tum. 28.306510202565413
 three and eleven she paid for those stockings in sparrow’s of george’s street on the tuesday, no the monday before easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself. 21.120241129461796
 cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature. 16.354940892463556
 gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. 11.497678949508947
 you would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. 6.158969529036731
 she could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve. 2.8612009796095115
 she put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. 8.009745068355707
 he was eying her as a snake eyes its prey. 4.874248461450455
 her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose. 6.7887446850346835
 edy boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby. 8.94476727567857
 irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers. 9.49993482002791
 and she said to gerty:  a penny for your thoughts. 2.5677583440950005
  what? replied gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. 3.064734680386609
 i was only wondering was it late. 3.5833455891218793
 because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late. 8.89899761055837
 and when cissy came up edy asked her the time and miss cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again. 13.588731703654897
 but edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early. 2.6587387144600814
  wait, said cissy, i’ll run ask my uncle peter over there what’s the time by his conundrum. 4.132042044265541
 so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church. 9.801537306061157
 passionate nature though he was gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. 3.790256915784053
 one moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure. 11.476284038309766
 cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set. 15.524559934593242
 his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones. 8.761420701172431
 cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order. 7.3324685372947105
 then they sang the second verse of the  tantum  ergo and canon o’hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told father conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and father conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time. 16.117093407161544
 it was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets. 8.826139528739418
 she felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. 16.31622343997543
 his dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine. 6.593520766316161
 if ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face. 4.544665174632421
 it is for you, gertrude macdowell, and you know it. 5.047777921198794
 edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon o’hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out  panem de coelo praestitisti  eis and edy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over. 30.835069407918258
 gerty winced sharply. 3.7161435896922246
 a brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. 2.3182104408434303
 it hurt o yes, it cut deep because edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was. 9.665186165816333
 gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. 8.497504903644213
 she had loved him better than he knew. 2.9943824959217755
 lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. 10.183806353435013
 their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see. 8.272211830160838
  o, responded gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up. 5.343837750624849
 i can throw my cap at who i like because it’s leap year. 3.3378813511830376
 her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily. 7.974570170615766
 there was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. 12.082487776005943
 as for mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces. 13.48126860032052
 and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. 8.5991713774956
 miss puny little edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it. 29.826355738627306
 edy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for master boardman junior. 12.110988968569098
 and cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib. 20.206855934353438
  o my! puddeny pie! protested ciss. 6.331538753189348
 he has his bib destroyed. 1.412279090942788
 the slight  contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights. 6.332492788690647
 gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because canon o’hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that father conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands. 21.338225344038108
 how moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry. 11.847705311505852
 and she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where reggy wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book  the  lamplighter by miss cummins, author of  mabel  vaughan and other tales. 22.980757782973534
 for gerty had her dreams that no one knew of. 4.913398812786372
 she loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from bertha supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean. 13.931230861941136
 it was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in hely’s of dame street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. 18.6302019979509
  art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by louis j walsh, magherafelt, and after there was something about  twilight, wilt thou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it. 29.82454605885177
 but it must end, she felt. 2.337337189485683
 if she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her. 3.073019801956915
 love laughs at locksmiths. 8.338263879376358
 she would make the great sacrifice. 1.2643137550655965
 her every effort would be to share his thoughts. 4.2242164330942
 dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness. 5.553443453726307
 there was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. 14.36083634522528
 but even if what then? would it make a very great difference? from everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled. 9.493577017344714
 she loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station. 11.093525253811547
 no, no: not that. 3.2975880703916642
 they would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of society with a big ess. 6.323061567157855
 perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. 4.731755245844284
 she thought she understood. 1.7956969719075995
 she would try to understand him because men were so different. 2.89844100649347
 the old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. 7.720026220931739
 heart of mine! she would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide. 17.763145997056284
 nothing else mattered. 1.4069389281083007
 come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free. 4.596669962486752
 canon o’hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang  laudate dominum omnes  gentes and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and father conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat edy asked wasn’t she coming but jacky caffrey called out:  o, look, cissy! and they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple. 25.607750330317863
  it’s fireworks, cissy caffrey said. 1.428998901219912
 and they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, edy with the pushcar with baby boardman in it and cissy holding tommy and jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running. 13.126850920077368
  come on, gerty, cissy called. 2.9254034063602825
 it’s the bazaar fireworks. 1.1701033973897161
 but gerty was adamant. 1.5810147871369111
 she had no intention of being at their beck and call. 2.868243385441915
 if they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was. 6.0266829341437465
 the eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling. 4.841066966763033
 she looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her. 6.072419207964717
 whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his. 8.443633432166553
 at last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips. 14.407488902702097
 his hands and face were working and a tremour went over her. 3.7253959015354954
 she leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because bertha supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the congested districts board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed. 35.89505588914964
 but this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips. 11.244024030153838
 besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and cissy caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and winny rippingham so mad about actors’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did. 17.883592490052656
 and jacky caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. 17.085696417470178
 she would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl’s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. 18.88583944391971
 and then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and o! then the roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of o! and everyone cried o! o! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, o so lovely, o, soft, sweet, soft! then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. 26.482666711318657
 ah! she glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl. 7.424362266489604
 he was leaning back against the rock behind. 1.4655704927821578
 leopold bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. 7.181672500535315
 what a brute he had been! at it again? a fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? an utter cad he had been! he of all men! but there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered. 25.707618228516044
 should a girl tell? no, a thousand times no. 4.215625477860873
 that was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell. 11.843771123209597
 cissy caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried:  gerty! gerty! we’re going. 8.35815557395831
 come on. 1.0
 we can see from farther up. 1.456823720877846
 gerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses. 3.0443246084449167
 she slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back. 4.324894296787373
 wonder if he’s too far to. 1.7220121327155362

 was it goodbye? no. 1.430695556925729
 she had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve. 7.547652686459184
 she drew herself up to her full height. 1.797856192253842
 their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. 7.870174610479741
 she half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted. 13.77247110948823
 slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to cissy, to edy to jacky and tommy caffrey, to little baby boardman. 20.385303492886816
 it was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed. 4.965674862195884
 she walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because because gerty macdowell was. 4.9258384310226875

 i knew she could whistle. 1.4776044765289085
 mouth made for that. 1.3404031570729207

 when she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue. 3.383871919244479
 your head it simply swirls. 1.2233072386188664
 he’s right. 1.0
 might have made a worse fool of myself however. 2.4877146048860306
 instead of talking about nothing. 2.101909586799996
 then i will tell you all. 1.8326011697530018
 still it was a kind of language between us. 1.9342488824024469
 it couldn’t be? no, gerty they called her. 2.4316992767608454
 might be false name however like my name and the address dolphin’s barn a blind. 3.7547147329138264
 her maiden name was jemina brown and she lived with her mother in irishtown. 3.802372655564079
 place made me think of that i suppose. 3.285670622534317
 all tarred with the same brush. 3.0589421301096076

 but the ball rolled down to her as if it understood. 2.6710769992461865
 every bullet has its billet. 2.879923894262808
 course i never could throw anything straight at school. 1.933378036082653
 crooked as a ram’s horn. 2.427725538316601
 sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa’s pants will soon fit willy and fuller’s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah. 11.006406149903686
 no soft job. 2.012102168706446

 cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds. 7.158246440402741

 wonder is nurse callan there still. 2.1034123517991796
 she used to look over some nights when molly was in the coffee palace. 1.8348401824522107
 that young doctor o’hare i noticed her brushing his coat. 3.476591357462328
 and mrs breen and mrs dignam once like that too, marriageable. 4.927110475115532
 worst of all at night mrs duggan told me in the city arms. 3.4106999930152124
 husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat. 3.5094023740561404
 have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose. 3.665727799266421
 then ask in the morning: was i drunk last night? bad policy however to fault the husband. 6.910410334210185
 chickens come home to roost. 2.2564128335669484
 they stick by one another like glue. 2.0114905200302373
 maybe the women’s fault also. 1.3640548825159087
 that’s where molly can knock spots off them. 2.3743803080694335
 it’s the blood of the south. 2.38276387710802
 also the form, the figure. 1.6157946577359592
 hands felt for the opulent. 1.3335918083831086

 wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. 3.6454815949881265
 allow me to introduce my. 2.4154717097262735
 then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn’t know what to call her. 6.24288434617617
 always see a fellow’s weak point in his wife. 2.0834825514440793
 still there’s destiny in it, falling in love. 2.720306956045871
 have their own secrets between them. 1.584470500531304
 chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn’t take them in hand. 4.832765210015378
 then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies. 8.333271585359496
 as god made them he matched them. 4.302690583668756
 sometimes children turn out well enough. 4.989254940129655
 twice nought makes one. 2.022041113690575
 or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. 3.3731882824571033
 marry in may and repent in december. 3.801143719256813
 this wet is very unpleasant. 2.152840922498948

 very strange about my watch. 1.803764356668315
 wristwatches are always going wrong. 1.7095139887636743
 wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he. 5.644359373542278
 yes, i suppose, at once. 2.033542754397433
 cat’s away, the mice will play. 1.4820433728789162
 i remember looking in pill lane. 1.7502626894348232
 also that now is magnetism. 3.899690511680693
 back of everything magnetism. 1.3839856330862952
 earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. 3.049300535827813
 that causes movement. 1.1188225601802013
 and time, well that’s the time the movement takes. 9.322270425935349
 then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. 7.241056124927747
 because it’s all arranged. 1.1528580365060426
 magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun, the stars. 4.151641933567978
 little piece of steel iron. 1.3443708479135836

 fork and steel. 2.039124617753117
 molly, he. 1.2842766172663325
 dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you’re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you. 17.801829607090994
 have to let fly. 1.2411872403093809
 wonder how is she feeling in that region. 2.4189322097618633
 shame all put on before third person. 3.141100713731356
 more put out about a hole in her stocking. 2.222481593443833
 molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show. 10.702987883347987
 and when the painters were in lombard street west. 1.875231624948748
 fine voice that fellow had. 2.103532866314815
 how giuglini began. 9.80165598042313
 smell that i did. 1.63686345490914
 like flowers. 1.0
 it was too. 1.2815749203422973
 came from the turpentine probably in the paint. 2.6419126964778705

 same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear. 3.542668693011137
 but lots of them can’t kick the beam, i think. 2.1125453068091535
 keep that thing up for hours. 4.513247764875928
 kind of a general all round over me and half down my back. 7.71687702925922
 that’s her perfume. 1.0307231872145226
 why she waved her hand. 1.1300230831928442
 i leave you this to think of me when i’m far away on the pillow. 3.443872094443657
 what is it? heliotrope? no. 2.592758840145652
 hyacinth? hm. 1.0270095299259938
 roses, i think. 1.4687748787125108
 she’d like scent of that kind. 1.6791911882477009
 sweet and cheap: soon sour. 3.4279860331362153
 why molly likes opoponax. 2.179514312505006
 suits her, with a little jessamine mixed. 5.999674760485844
 her high notes and her low notes. 3.1730748294478315
 at the dance night she met him, dance of the hours. 2.785569617881344
 heat brought it out. 2.670137123835528
 she was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. 5.276523695990785
 good conductor, is it? or bad? light too. 5.899257637120256
 suppose there’s some connection. 1.4810862790109993
 for instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark. 2.2047707844515094
 mysterious thing too. 1.2431401143768144
 why did i smell it only now? took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure. 6.338101672496162
 suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across. 1.656031392430493
 yes, it is. 1.6899532152302261
 because those spice islands, cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off. 5.937080275486681
 tell you what it is. 2.0602420629900418
 it’s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they’re always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it. 11.314278899828858
 clings to everything she takes off. 1.8697271663606652
 vamp of her stockings. 1.0444157899304896
 warm shoe. 1.0
 drawers: little kick, taking them off. 4.55313482513073
 byby till next time. 2.160158613488255

 know her smell in a thousand. 2.2411676375442955
 bathwater too. 1.0
 reminds me of strawberries and cream. 2.631055976605104
 wonder where it is really. 1.5667243923838892
 there or the armpits or under the neck. 4.6341552957663765
 because you get it out of all holes and corners. 2.173057657122861
 hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something. 5.30974477012511
 bag under their tails. 1.0952229759037804

 dogs at each other behind. 1.6728415977796265
 good evening. 1.0
 how do you sniff? hm. 1.7255181708917264
 very well, thank you. 1.2965099596975813
 animals go by that. 1.3223940706972495
 yes now, look at it that way. 2.9792012471400917
 we’re the same. 1.011497414543589
 some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period. 4.29581067336994
 come near. 1.0
 then get a hogo you could hang your hat on. 3.348013773143976
 like what? potted herrings gone stale or. 2.480822561200441
 boof! please keep off the grass. 2.415988680293906
 perhaps they get a man smell off us. 3.199312859904601
 what though? cigary gloves long john had on his desk the other day. 6.347080629526344
 breath? what you eat and drink gives that. 6.2577529504446
 mansmell, i mean. 1.2780046989956726
 must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different. 4.482107167610631
 women buzz round it like flies round treacle. 5.48299028939265
 railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. 5.0140573039150675
 the tree of forbidden priest. 3.7937016878530136
 o, father, will you? let me be the first to. 4.867631618466117

 i knew there was something on my mind. 1.8048858989222216
 never went back and the soap not paid. 2.648889832673082
 dislike carrying bottles like that hag this morning. 1.5217997482294932
 hynes might have paid me that three shillings. 2.3896231172276683
 i could mention meagher’s just to remind him. 4.202649824330417
 still if he works that paragraph. 3.0049073510084594
 two and nine. 1.338571695384646
 bad opinion of me he’ll have. 1.750036531830289

 grace after meals. 1.4924848762083573
 after supper walk a mile. 2.6495326375253736

 certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided. 56.0650845492342

 she said that he had a fair sweet death through god his goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men’s oil to his limbs. 9.343121363150102
 the man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in mona island through bellycrab three year agone come childermas and she prayed to god the allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness. 18.70154388532939
 he heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring. 6.969578164752849
 so stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other. 10.097775130309675
 therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother’s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came. 18.90052404919246
 the man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed. 7.05635479199825
 the nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be. 12.641800918226128
 she said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman’s birth. 5.640091237529234
 then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house. 9.211311598733174
 the man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid. 15.87457511528554
 nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless. 2.8728834525643934
 and whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. 9.292972285960376
 and there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept dixon. 3.217844923840009
 and the traveller leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. 19.4196700585859
 and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there. 8.272413949843953
 and the traveller leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. 5.105444210123888
 also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. 17.948910091979204
 but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle. 7.078851582438313
 and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery. 6.939064481404986
 and in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment. 9.988099219314973
 and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously. 19.166428328855627
 and there were vessels that are wrought by magic of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles. 8.066427474384938
 and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. 7.619281540940548
 and there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. 18.317063865381247
 and these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. 10.494105168492675
 and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. 13.161860292428042
 and they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead. 9.67649478846464
 and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. 14.168127266041099
 and childe leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile. 25.128782375237222
 and he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile. 4.188448495062604
 thanked be almighty god. 1.7003525610106642
 this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast. 14.701025552820733
 sir leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel, said he, that it be not come or now. 13.907419083095542
 meseems it dureth overlong. 3.670825099596717
 and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently. 16.687985053476744
 but, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long. 8.879286124362855
 and the franklin that had drunken said, expecting each moment to be her next. 3.5898512993770004
 also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness. 17.13564308292308
 and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup. 17.323979677684854
 woman’s woe with wonder pondering. 2.0869116039912763
 now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might. 7.167007690287438
 there was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, dixon yclept junior of saint mary merciable’s with other his fellows lynch and madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa, one crotthers, and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir leopold. 41.7959676244838
 but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow. 13.740990763926025
 and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner. 17.593754678629583
 ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave. 12.193257786929292
 for they were right witty scholars. 1.4787082154372402
 and he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in horne’s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). 26.75449491839327
 and they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die. 10.621908506668442
 and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy. 18.729155867400365
 a redress god grant. 4.378389238525596
 this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our virgin mother, the wife should live and the babe to die. 10.076805233943809
 in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack. 15.634901025650139
 then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved. 11.377507389435497
 to whom young stephen had these words following: murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. 6.305185604730443
 both babe and parent now glorify their maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire. 18.330235227452192
 but, gramercy, what of those godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the holy ghost, very god, lord and giver of life? for, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. 24.57723201722937
 we are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we. 2.7183414217956807
 then said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what ends. 3.8040421781514095
 but he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. 21.69315380865639
 whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachi’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do. 24.37766061217998
 thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever. 10.208617836584533
 then spake young stephen orgulous of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with,  effectu  secuto, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides. 43.34657363212965
 he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for god’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman’s seal, even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded. 17.319861407200566
 all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. 12.680781909412746
 a wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions. 31.5845007845616
 that is truth, pardy, said dixon, and, or i err, a pregnant word. 11.791176428220691
 which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons. 14.762392781683543
 but sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny. 24.612192612897477
 and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores. 36.88825524079998
 about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray. 18.595719905515786

 see ye here. 1.3478036951514425
 and he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ. 8.788944839901584
 they all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore. 5.892583069281523
 his words were then these as followeth: know all men, he said, time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions. 9.95772895297445

 hereupon punch costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch  staboo  stabella about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in almany which he did straightways now attack:  the first three months she was not well, staboo,_ when here nurse quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard. 33.10057279898057
 it was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently punch costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of god ape, the good sir leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred. 60.50188842050905
 in horne’s house rest should reign. 1.6060331175989886
 to be short this passage was scarce by when master dixon of mary in eccles, goodly grinning, asked young stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. 15.833288323116264
 master lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. 21.725843804964782
 but he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin. 7.165480288700034
 thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem  ut novetur sexus omnis corporis  mysterium till she was there unmaided. 33.2828926798625
 he gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets master john fletcher and master francis beaumont that is in their  maid’s  tragedy that was writ for a like twining of lovers:  to bed, to  bed was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals. 16.187784958402172

 well met they were, said master dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named beau mount and lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come. 19.851261809233772
 young stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it. 13.006649466523928

 thereto punch costello roared out mainly  etienne  chanson but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea. 18.066168173822103

 came now the storm that hist his heart. 4.778777307671822
 and master lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry. 6.784997303771643
 and he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. 19.431110380926967
 then did some mock and some jeer and punch costello fell hard again to his yale which master lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour. 8.551512191701391
 but the braggart boaster cried that an old nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead. 11.404676571722428
 but this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in horne’s hall. 6.074259395098749
 he drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that master madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and master bloom, at the braggart’s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon. 20.662067035293937
 but was young boasthard’s fear vanquished by calmer’s words? no, for he had in his bosom a spike named bitterness which could not by words be done away. 15.062605063669022
 and was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other? he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. 5.67598230581739
 but could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle holiness that then he lived withal? indeed no for grace was not there to find that bottle. 13.808236651097802
 heard he then in that clap the voice of the god bringforth or, what calmer said, a hubbub of phenomenon? heard? why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube understanding (which he had not done). 11.877428087777535
 for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show. 7.825847968182492
 and would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away? by no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law. 16.678141646692193
 then wotted he nought of that other land which is called believe onme, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it? yes, pious had told him of that land and chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is bird inthe hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named two inthe bush or, by some learned, carnal concupiscence. 45.94066944955439
 this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in manse of mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore bird inthe hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her. 15.576485865613876
 for regarding believe onme they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, two inthe bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, pickaback and topsyturvy and shameface and cheek by jowl and, second, for that foul plague allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named killchild. 27.206799930366554
 so were they all in their blind fancy, mr cavil and mr sometimes godly, mr ape swillale, mr false franklin, mr dainty dixon, young boasthard and mr cautious calmer. 11.067470722040028
 wherein, o wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth. 17.512723844217142

 with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk. 17.498673197307912

 the other, costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale. 5.234019163416103
 faith, no, he says, frank (that was his name), ’tis all about kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague. 11.032114044676344
 but they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it. 5.501767138434073
 there’s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset. 11.305313905939409
  mort aux  vaches, says frank then in the french language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in bordeaux and he spoke french like a gentleman too. 11.100484222981295
 from a child this frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes. 18.413067412378545
 one time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. 18.9064658972062
 he had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him. 10.67881310376614
 what, says mr leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all? i protest i saw them but this day morning going to the liverpool boats, says he. 10.484471915569154
 i can scarce believe ’tis so bad, says he. 2.1388535756731293
 and he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for mr joseph cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by mr gavin low’s yard in prussia street. 12.88056500873142
 i question with you there, says he. 2.472885000990206
 more like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue. 2.9385458471188435
 mr stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over doctor rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns. 15.464247901733877
 come, come, says mr vincent, plain dealing. 3.3170539644417567
 he’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s irish, says he. 4.753601581214801
 irish by name and irish by nature, says mr stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an irish bull in an english chinashop. 8.103620248479453
 i conceive you, says mr dixon. 1.3512680692756953
 it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose. 5.589818825884337
 true for you, says mr vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. 11.659590216844883
 he had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains. 16.346614791936258
 what for that, says mr dixon, but before he came over farmer nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself. 8.703588548138281
 so be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. 8.206671011193652
 but the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says mr vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all ireland. 22.154135876224426
 another then put in his word: and they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content. 19.15942597267962
 by this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture. 5.901417687675673
 to remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him. 19.824161024609833
 ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: by the lord harry, green is the grass that grows on the ground. 14.59298896620264
 and, says mr dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or the wilds of connemara or a husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord harry’s orders. 18.17998609376962
 there was bad blood between them at first, says mr vincent, and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and i’ll meddle in his matters, says he. 7.397743848288704
 i’ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. 6.119237646880007
 but one evening, says mr dixon, when the lord harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the romans,  bos  bovum, which is good bog latin for boss of the show. 21.94759978677992
 after that, says mr vincent, the lord harry put his head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name. 8.869308578942118
 then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat. 23.406046993734364
 in short, he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt. 5.721663885785289
 they were, says mr stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of america. 47.04513579429894
 which was the occasion, says mr vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: _ pope peter’s but a pissabed. 6.7659987170685465
 a man’s a man for a’ that. 7.13664524586516
_ our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name alec bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. 15.373223785124036
 mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on. 7.200126986912906
 whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at mr quinnell’s bearing a legend printed in fair italics:  mr malachi mulligan. 8.700091001666594
 fertiliser and incubator. 1.3033479036412188
 lambay  island. 1.0
 his project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir fopling popinjay and sir milksop quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. 21.709178315456626
 well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said mr dixon. 4.414944705038545
 i make no doubt it smacks of wenching. 3.20485850769049
 come, be seated, both. 3.0431442162375992
 ’tis as cheap sitting as standing. 5.43045043510421
 mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired. 21.357896862057732
 it grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep. 25.91417994800055
 to curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of lambay island from its holder, lord talbot de malahide, a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party. 20.08763349746193
 he proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named  omphalos with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural. 15.360965952148765
 money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains. 4.354504741163508
 the poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. 13.414750488854093
 for his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies. 20.738092385829294
 after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it. 11.079444324983484
 they both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by mr mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald. 9.041501270747327
 his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of mary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle. 11.658687339478982
 mr mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention:  talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, o quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum romanorum magnopere  anteponunt, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck. 47.9269245218378
 valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced. 21.52110716540426
 the young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour. 10.083843798884685
 mr mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give? who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of horne’s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. 23.921277584236126
 mr dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, mr austin meldon, to a wolf in the stomach. 20.942213782963307
 for answer mr mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of mother grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’s a trollop): there’s a belly that never bore a bastard. 8.37017120217776
 this was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. 9.742234165693894
 the spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber. 6.980738258049498
 here the listener who was none other than the scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. 36.455125274689436
  mais bien  sûr, noble stranger, said he cheerily,  et mille  compliments. 8.20381242138625
 that you may and very opportunely. 4.581029950127454
 there wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity. 3.3501516108927136
 but, gracious heaven, was i left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my god, i would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the giver of good things. 17.811699321334956
 with these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. 16.29173664006346
 gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, ah, monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’pon my conscience, even you, monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. 21.61335550242065
 i declare, i was never so touched in all my life. 4.209916680185671
 god, i thank thee, as the author of my days! thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours. 8.038028969638653
 a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again. 7.626655047803468
 beneficent disseminator of blessings to all thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years. 30.04899565149467
 but indeed, sir, i wander from the point. 2.094288722556088
 how mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys. 8.548394759246094
 maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish. 2.066552516458483
 would to god that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! i could weep to think of it. 5.808405784996302
 then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. 5.660513636214717
 but beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, i know of a  marchand de  capotes, monsieur poyntz, from whom i can have for a  livre as snug a cloak of the french fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting. 18.763003851534073
 tut, tut! cries le fécondateur, tripping in, my friend monsieur moore, that most accomplished traveller (i have just cracked a half bottle  avec  lui in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in cape horn,  ventre  biche, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak. 18.123584251196256
 a drenching of that violence, he tells me,  sans  blague, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world. 13.798174038950508
 pooh! a  livre!_ cries monsieur lynch. 2.8254511395641537
 the clumsy things are dear at a sou. 4.152732765408105
 one umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps. 6.501265980727458
 no woman of any wit would wear one. 3.8713455505050747
 my dear kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that  il y a deux  choses for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment. 22.541211631177056
 the first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as i handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath. 11.126257277612218
 but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge. 6.562512140410221
 amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, miss callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company. 11.584155016607179
 the presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry. 15.80986808500333
 strike me silly, said costello, a low fellow who was fuddled. 4.24096375209627
 a monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! i’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you. 6.892324396751045
 what, you dog? have you a way with them? gad’s bud, immensely so, said mr lynch. 10.818367342184562
 the bedside manner it is that they use in the mater hospice. 2.821561974794621
 demme, does not doctor o’gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin. 5.663125519091819
 as i look to be saved i had it from my kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months. 5.009903880344732
 lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! drat the man! bless me, i’m all of a wibbly wobbly. 18.30282128250188
 why, you’re as bad as dear little father cantekissem, that you are! may this pot of four half choke me, cried costello, if she aint in the family way. 13.732463376414248
 i knows a lady what’s got a white swelling quick as i claps eyes on her. 4.223104744652557
 the young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward. 8.07320551222025
 merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was  enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy. 9.101373773311746
 i want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth. 11.00266315829505
 i am positive when i say that if need were i could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast. 10.82754354798552
 i cannot away with them. 1.9445665886144317
 what? malign such an one, the amiable miss callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours? and at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? perish the thought! i shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of horne. 22.305783803482864
 having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. 13.619494054767797
 a murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath. 23.99331837632042
 stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest frank costello which i was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what i always looks back on with a loving heart. 12.752072134793629
 to revert to mr bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. 13.795767881052795
 the young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous  mots were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. 31.802695222324402
 but the word of mr costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious mr darwin. 30.59196003201608
 it was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable. 46.699298970860234
 to those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat. 22.66609312914377
 not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the holy writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions. 19.983656808410952
 to conclude, while from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the supreme being. 20.549037689015222
