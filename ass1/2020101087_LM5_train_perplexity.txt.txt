 the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred. 10.759467174189481
 at present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was the head quarters. 13.313252153530026
" "now i have got some news for you," said lydia, as they sat down to table. 2.7965829997229337
 but i can guess how it was; every body says that he is ate up with pride, and i dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise. 11.572488673493618
" elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them. 3.463790582764656

 she felt that she had no business at pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. 3.967616602323682
 she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance. 5.491754062797281

 she talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, "now, i do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr collins and me have a little conversation together. 21.802397530493348
 i was never more annoyed! the insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people! what would i give to hear your strictures on them!" "your conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you. 12.65414159219719
 lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. 14.996199903988405
" however little Mr darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer. 8.168658281849087

 will you hear it?" "most willingly. 2.678300807716354
 Mr bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. 5.248241624558415
 well, any friend of Mr bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him. 9.836826967511781
 as a clergyman, moreover, i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. 19.642592329136157
 "Mr collins," said she, "speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, i suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman. 11.782611655469546
 a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter. 9.507246737205978
 lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs bennet. 5.530857876884907
 his fear of her, has always operated, i know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh, which i am certain he has very much at heart. 10.525739294626927
 if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one. 10.462384031653688
" catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to london. 8.550605768614775
 "lizzy," said he, "i was going to look for you; come into my room. 4.219729507871107
 for your sake," turning to charlotte, "i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. 4.84769034797984
 she was ashamed to think how much. 1.342813723673013
 jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that  she would not give into it. 5.826627450340498
 catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort. 4.859830119275711
 "'tis too much!" she added, "by far too much. 3.753202466879774
 with respect to wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr darcy afterwards discharged. 19.12697384578792
" "no governess! how was that possible? five daughters brought up at home without a governess! i never heard of such a thing. 5.770144045845574
 had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it. 18.869958334284224
 it was the favourite wish of  his mother, as well as of her's. 10.409097400839366

 had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. 14.495726665160026
" "i deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried elizabeth; "i am  not a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things. 5.275014775318489
 the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by  him. 2.586812248225488
 wickham's affection for lydia, was just what elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to lydia's for him. 9.134629866598443

 is it true?" elizabeth replied that it was. 2.2998753170397186
 she wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "this must be false! this cannot be! this must be the grossest falsehood!" and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again. 12.639247698408786
 when alone with elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. 4.459132388040279
-"i, who have prided myself on my discernment! i, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust. 10.127306283743534
 if, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's, i can only say that i am sorry. 8.408125240117963
 it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. 20.945604084943636
 we have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady catherine de bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye. 3.7278331524771704
" this was not very consoling to Mrs bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before, "i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. 7.764029882777647
 and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail? we cannot suppose he would help it, if he could. 8.594721734195826
 Mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. 4.663635345207068
" "have you any idea, lizzy, who this gentleman is? but now it comes out. 6.299559246296261
" Mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then added, "may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr and Mrs collins well. 8.343804723635843
" "that is very true," replied elizabeth, "and i could easily forgive  his pride, if he had not mortified  mine. 2.604788273529217
 the first week of their return was soon gone. 1.456598975931901
 "come here, child," cried her father as she appeared. 4.4405943686027864
 it is natural that obligation should be felt, and if i could  feel gratitude, i would now thank you. 4.2933197586673275
 having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. 13.81170326096678
 if Mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?" "because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. 18.258061458238764
 it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. 8.259417919836393
 "oh, lizzy! it cannot be. 2.7861968722863986
 happy shall i be, when his stay at netherfield is over!" "i wish i could say any thing to comfort you," replied elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power. 6.1742328921003065
 you may have drawn him in. 1.2172961066235177
 if it was not for the entail i should not mind it. 2.9719354282070394
 Mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family; jane heard them with horror. 3.20342778130536
 he is perfectly amiable. 1.1479249122015531
" "perfectly so i thank you. 3.426587841143288
 she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr darcy that Mr darcy might leave the country, but that  he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week. 13.135248112330483
 Mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance. 10.85166837349887
 my feelings in every respect forbid it. 1.1755378157480398
 with  your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! affectation of candour is common enough; one meets it every where. 8.606791644581763
 you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me. 6.086635942805445
 however, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were. 4.178613315780384
 but enough of this. 1.3646519629106777
 were it known to the rest of my family, i should not have merely my own gratitude to express. 3.8461070034466873
 the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl. 2.0803651911365013
" "oh! you mean jane, i suppose because he danced with her twice. 2.9162179041962744
" "oh! no it is not for  me to be driven away by Mr darcy. 3.4868670869973757
 i do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this. 4.811951956481819
 putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said, "i did not know before that you ever walked this way. 5.615984460929747
" "and of your infliction," cried elizabeth with energy. 2.1109470233719967
" she would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, "oh! Mr bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. 8.480265213413007
 elizabeth was now to see Mr wickham for the last time. 4.701317590145088
 from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr collins's side, and as many bows on sir william's, they departed. 10.388633415702124
 most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other. 5.001428129190738
 but, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference. 17.375727286916955
 she was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when miss bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. 9.385945346220161
 many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man. 12.895414912381089
 how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine. 2.399116056036072
 but she is nothing to me now. 1.849391176600932
 their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets; and jane more especially, who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had  she been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure. 10.83220609530216
 she was met in the vestibule by lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "i am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! what do you think has happened this morning? Mr collins has made an offer to lizzy, and she will not have him. 11.352582318977259
" "i did not know before," continued bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character. 3.713921127460248
 she wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject. 2.3505018714100294
 lord! how i should like to be married before any of you; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls. 4.8389060357898535
 lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that  he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter. 10.526335922924183
 my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better. 2.34657318192215
" "some time or other he  will be but it shall not be by  me. 7.269088949549811
 "but it is fortunate," thought she, "that i have something to wish for. 3.510441333721888
 i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr denny comes back from town. 7.618166092901504
" she paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. 5.8987234244764135
 to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. 4.124875053877262
 every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. 4.338164826932745
" "my dear Mr bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. 3.843775366787781
 chapter iii. 1.0
 allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety. 13.92652729397969
 my dear jane, i am in such a flutter, that i am sure i can't write; so i will dictate, and you write for me. 6.716299548508311

 i know your disposition, lizzy. 1.2200929293385725
 after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began, "in vain have i struggled. 9.184718929299214

 "you write uncommonly fast. 1.352906168299281
" consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr bingley in consequence of it, before  they did. 10.935553154796763
 "there has been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way. 4.530593423882411
 as soon as they had driven from the door, elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings, which, for charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. 8.48097964046955

" his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to netherfield. 6.036884208082536
 " you began the evening well, charlotte," said Mrs bennet with civil self command to miss lucas. 11.23217650170848
 these are conditions, which, considering every thing, i had no hesitation in complying with, as far as i thought myself privileged, for you. 5.619391534836045
" on his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said, "did not you think, Mr darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton?" "with great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic. 19.694762347016365
 others of the party were now applied to. 2.6746188351067515
 on his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "let me call your maid. 8.775896212068625
 your mother will never see you again if you do  not marry Mr collins, and i will never see you again if you  do. 8.462338321654736
 "is miss darcy much grown since the spring?" said miss bingley; "will she be as tall as i am?" "i think she will. 5.11316155453813

" "and if i had not a letter to write myself, i might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. 7.362366321029161
" "well, then, you need not be under any alarm. 2.2921066191571122
 "i will go to meryton," said she, "as soon as i am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister philips. 4.658420033754252

 rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother inlaw's intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. 13.107392579264834

 elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said, "i was surprised to see darcy in town last month. 4.042243830697347
 at such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. 17.66521327138919
 i wonder what he can be doing there. 2.1266823215983366
 jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr darcy's looks and behaviour. 16.110531180835117
 though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced. 5.436333175755827

 "sure he will not leave london before he has found them. 2.738996164491713

 they saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. 7.350777384079646
 Mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. 22.84583661017529
 he has not an ill natured look. 2.610647060001834

" "i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it. 3.348991603107643
 seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence. 4.751461802791334
 thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where i assure you there are many amiable young women. 5.490870531686661
" elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed. 7.204372405393519

 his anxiety for jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. 8.276493007308737
 Mrs gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how  she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but elizabeth had turned away her head. 9.30855114968708

 miss de bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes. 18.074703903164487
 he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. 11.271480044344383

 one has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it. 4.846318370286809
 miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men. 18.94340376227942

 we want none of them; do we?" darcy had walked away to another part of the room. 5.307757614743288
 elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. 5.01252620244461
 she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. 7.097275337010793
 in short, my dear aunt, i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted, or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? all that i can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. 24.06113213338927
 chapter xix. 1.0
" elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match. 25.352345776542883
" Mrs bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of  her, in spite of all miss bingley's witticisms on  fine  eyes. 17.971640181333584

 but, my dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of  your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend. 14.901028970281407

 there was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies. 4.789734076641611
 as for their mother, Mr collins's letter had done away much of her ill will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters. 10.060515201234402
" "certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. 6.098808817959543

 their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this! let me never see either one or the other again!" yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover. 20.106623471525758
 when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. 6.698453562401943
" Mrs bennet's eyes sparkled. 3.4075249577523317
 Mr denny and Mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of miss lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation. 20.21558870856472
 howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion i am not only joined by Mrs collins, but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter, to whom i have related the affair. 10.659749242205995
 lady catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to darcy, "miss bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a london master. 9.564276749135459
 i shall certainly try to get the better. 1.7368208686089441
 "having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority. 9.079853773013358
 when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. 20.759837579545493
 lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs bennet's sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away. 12.419590581175846
 when Mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte. 8.459718638891928
 not that i mean to find fault with  you, for such things i know are all chance in this world. 8.091664389361458
" "oh! certainly," said elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions. 4.258299630897066
 lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr collins, in describing the civility of Mr and Mrs philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house. 25.638434786321373
" "i do, i do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "i love him. 5.019574646183054
 "i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. 13.056763215537744

 elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. 2.6231519724316286
 but when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. 16.45050237386285
 she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to mary at all. 3.673025849176607
 darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather  knew that she was happy, than  felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. 17.21428723780065

 many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; i wish i could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that i despair. 12.89014923470128
 kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step. 4.738515819295194
 i thank you, again and again, for not going to the lakes. 4.418392366204798

 Mr collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him. 4.284958856962512

 his first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. 10.754758233203372
 in this danger kitty is also comprehended. 1.8615018815634106

 there was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. 10.65616245641966
 Mr hurst and Mr bingley were at piquet, and Mrs hurst was observing their game. 5.441817291703749

 she read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. 9.65474076507401
 their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr darcy was attending them to their carriage, miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. 14.536498227177095
 "your friend performs delightfully;" he continued after a pause, on seeing bingley join the group;-"and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr darcy. 9.156102836567026
 had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. 17.5181068616251

"i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future. 11.4469187422268

 every park has its beauty and its prospects; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh. 14.62181477743069

 she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters. 13.744569464414454
" "yes," replied darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but  that was only when i first knew her, for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance. 7.984767421100716

 elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley. 25.585574739446997
 from the farther disadvantage of lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going. 11.798481776111132

 i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but i was over ruled, as i always am. 5.054189754646707
 what a contrast between him and his friend! Mr darcy danced only once with Mrs hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. 13.720515167682823
 elizabeth had settled it that Mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her, the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. 13.053500474919234

 while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible. 10.018440172175794

 the only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter. 14.849403045058006
 as they passed through the hall, lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on. 7.290239333693587

 the evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and elizabeth. 6.5898935691470415
 jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. 6.719351610248898

 wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish. 21.124313401639537

 this, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, i hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr wickham. 8.970603715588727
 every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch. 4.068281495770075
 it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling. 5.879112158110876
 how could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been. 8.023206568555187
 but is it certain, absolutely certain?" "oh yes! they left brighton together on sunday night, and were traced almost to london, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to scotland. 13.029415868298255
 she remembered also, that till the netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son. 20.3449211767615
 Mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at netherfield. 11.869891111855972
" kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry. 3.957157121645009
 in as short a time as Mr collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. 16.866516799305124
 amongst the most violent against him was Mrs bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters. 9.451555353220414
" "true; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room. 1.8055826580854824

 elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. 4.080964949037596
 such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr bingley's continued absence. 11.813653221752592
 but above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked. 6.6238488906066335
 i did not expect such a compliment. 1.163695042538179
 they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her, "so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham! your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old wickham, the late Mr darcy's steward. 15.745965389980976
 the colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. 14.650231501598444
 "she is my youngest girl but one. 2.193225156120954
 "come, darcy," said he, "i must have you dance. 5.281060821669164
 never, even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield, or his dignified relations at rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings. 21.883517631497487
" "i must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied jane, "and i hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together. 4.665490340671454
 she answered him with cold civility. 1.7624095907832398
" "and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself? does he know his real character?" "i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did. 4.52480374352496

" "to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either. 3.640042274906776
 had she not seen him in derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there  with his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it. 12.325793284278083

 the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. 14.384600217435048

 "i am by no means of opinion, i assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her. 20.568201281853916
 he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr darcy had been staying there. 9.77452148697934

 but before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her. 3.061958869351126
" in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. 12.841722143174799
 had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable. 18.288462106467517
 we must have Mrs long and the gouldings soon. 3.949079112716287
" the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret. 3.5189854640741087
 she is almost three and twenty! lord, how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty! my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think. 8.051158564654312
" her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation. 9.848368429519418
 so, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. 8.435315307913447
 "who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?" "his misfortunes!" repeated darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed. 9.83449399916357
 she tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. 16.848424700722617
 elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. 11.701952409057329

 but jane and elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. 15.136420921151675
 to the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. 12.044635321574487
 he was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in derbyshire. 4.922725878273901

 miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. 4.542780524203103
" "to oblige you, i would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him, i should only think worse of her understanding, than i now do of her heart. 9.858016256631894
 she dreaded seeing wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. 2.9310716213619887
 Mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, &c. 3.6456717775206324

 within doors there was lady catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. 16.873450508149997
 her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. 2.012328568364747

" "how can you talk so?" said jane faintly smiling,-"you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, i could not hesitate. 5.063187088719046
" "oh! my dear," cried his wife, "i cannot bear to hear that mentioned. 2.206144476369305
" "certainly," he replied, biting his lips. 3.2020660904389233
 you must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much. 5.1097285551356
 elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it. 15.713135220620742
 he was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. 7.096260472155484

" "after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. 14.151127924110986
 bingley was by no means deficient, but darcy was clever. 2.8375940168571567

 lydia was a stout, well grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. 8.078545889095038
 in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. 2.3218172487045283
 "and this is always the way with him," she added. 2.433707073356166
 against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged jane to borrow Mr bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made. 19.153742868796108

 "you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, i am sure, to oblige us for one half hour. 10.362253485302658
 an hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to longbourn. 18.12046394390813
 "i am going to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows. 2.463003693762942
 you must send john with the young ladies, Mrs collins. 5.108082485676217
 elizabeth looked expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know i am married to day? i was afraid they might not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle, so i was determined he should know it, and so i let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then i bowed and smiled like any thing. 42.08557738135939
 her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield, to longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire. 9.071157795853843
 but her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands. 9.280311598385222
 her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness. 12.112315122901537

 i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr darcy. 5.466540106068114
 his affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. 8.58075129513595
 hope was over, entirely over; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. 8.617097288098988
 as for jane,  her anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. 13.703289236966237

 what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? as a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship! how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! how much of good or evil must be done by him! every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression. 26.924685838231994

 they were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. 14.111846560907084

 they were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs bennet and kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what elizabeth felt. 10.429567264543502
 that they might have met without ill consequence, is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. 6.60380362359007

 the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. 12.77046437349995

 Mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour, till sir william thus began. 7.596660555263461

 i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. 5.568391204055933
 i have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with. 5.694961417347191
" "no, lizzy, that is what i do  not choose. 2.1444081509849986
 and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married. 7.41283754806544
 "there were some very strong objections against the lady," were colonel fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in london. 12.815585357374472
" "and i certainly  never shall give it. 2.563025157952336
 at length the parsonage was discernible. 2.258617345384259
" "i had much rather go in the coach. 1.7734589910207665
" "i am sick of Mr bingley," cried his wife. 2.2711898875089056
" the picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed rooms, were all that remained to be shewn. 4.501059874639317
 but really, ma'am, i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. 7.546993851571767
" "indeed, mama, you are mistaken," said elizabeth, blushing for her mother. 3.509281089967529
 one day's delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual. 4.585894547133748
 she watched him whenever they were at rosings, and whenever he came to hunsford; but without much success. 3.094028282852124
 she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. 10.593880524566897
 how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters i cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr collins too! why should  he have it more than anybody else?" "i leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr bennet. 14.971727583432052
" elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. 4.52166245014564
" "but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham. 1.9608144777637064
 every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight. 8.16961341082587
 forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make  me your confidante. 4.153489558002807
 you know how i detest it, unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner. 3.213324884391652
" "an unhappy alternative is before you, elizabeth. 6.472829607183723
 he must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on. 4.4669902444008
 you know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself. 3.7974138867863485
" "you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate. 2.878128194247086
 "books oh! no. 6.444882290989151
 he has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing. 4.690775177282459
 there is a lady, it seems, a Mrs younge, who was some time ago governess to miss darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. 9.436963606595818
 you are to understand, miss bennet, that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will i be dissuaded from it. 8.457757674758128
" elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit. 3.575671658377224
" this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss bingley. 5.2650000791606795
 but he is an ugly fellow! i am glad he is gone. 2.3025865388386957
 she resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. 11.002450011009982
 "where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door. 2.5397343149625122
 lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. 6.88459782205837
 the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place, that she might be farther from the door. 9.190706389001441
" "and what is your success?" she shook her head. 1.8194570417275089
 for though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body. 8.405379440280635
 miss darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. 9.598203224104736
 five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs bennet, for many years after lydia's birth, had been certain that he would. 9.826600706287397
 miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. 11.14597557594065
 kitty stared at him, and lydia exclaimed. 1.751090707085182
 a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little. 2.1215000609220667
 and who knows what  may happen? but that is nothing to us. 4.0282285257494355
 what an agreeable man sir william is, Mr bingley is not he? so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy! he has always something to say to every body. 11.66156182615952
 and then when we came away it was such fun! i thought we never should have got into the coach. 4.307709402026171
 at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration. 10.020523436036408
 and then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. 5.196087149533625
 but he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not. 8.254124718972916
" "oh! thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!" cried elizabeth when she had finished it. 4.235981877829669
" "oh!" said lydia stoutly, "i am not afraid; for though i  am the youngest, i'm the tallest. 5.8636958194717055
" "aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if i had known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. 7.803310581351529
 lady catherine, sir william, and Mr and Mrs collins sat down to quadrille; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs jenkinson to make up her party. 12.370687143962241
" "neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. 5.487635518246791
 "then, who taught you? who attended to you? without a governess you must have been neglected. 5.324068711274869
" "true. 1.0
 but i will not repine. 1.1346740810036646
 i certainly  have had my share of beauty, but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. 3.375398115032245
 he is come Mr bingley is come. 4.138670978520792
 elizabeth could but just  affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. 7.10138381722246
 far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter. 8.971526318634405
 not all that Mrs bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr bingley. 10.181723992161528
 but now it was all too natural. 3.394618140979968
 it is what every body says. 1.9862411059653207
 i had often seen him in love before. 1.6976036130943766
 my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me. 3.638260179646047
 besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the  shire have left meryton, and they are going in a fortnight. 6.586613346268882
 i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me  that. 2.8885121909628486
" Mr darcy's letter to lady catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr bennet sent to Mr collins, in reply to his last. 12.000850092689557
 on the very day of my coming home from longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. 3.361220830570227
 Mrs gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. 6.1057073194229865
 "lady catherine de bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living. 2.3749241510100365
 it was then disclosed in the following manner. 2.3905132220365863
 did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in kent?" "i  have heard from authority, which i thought  as  good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron. 13.038697776457957
 "they have both," said she, "been deceived, i dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea. 6.386210117059111
 it pains me to offend you. 3.0637875501021217
 i have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare. 9.669296842591468
" "and your assurance of it, i suppose, carried immediate conviction to him. 3.541625832261896
 in the hall they parted. 1.0634984534312275
 it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do. 19.596234372107197
 the world has been deceived in that respect; and i am happy to say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. 7.380484023949176
 had lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned. 12.606961898799963
" "we are not in a way to know  what Mr bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit. 4.849986203091912
" sir william only smiled. 2.6306350306253456
 she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers. 10.096791581960376
 chapter xix. 1.0
 though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. 13.239643032807209
 chapter x. 1.0
 elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. 2.1630421010475214
 darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it. 2.951246304468957
" "speak to lizzy about it yourself. 3.864889855169533
 every girl in, or near meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished  her by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites. 11.12041277041105
 on being made acquainted with the present Mr darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard Mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill natured boy. 12.944508076005036
 she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class. 18.032546753359856
" "aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself. 9.737348317584235
 balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. 2.409472821086301
 it was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. 3.7301810744119326
 but let me advise you to think better of it. 2.660706497518689
 i have done with you from this very day. 2.2413417777076567
 are you going much farther?" "no, i should have turned in a moment. 3.5672905112565263
 but however he did not. 1.474404807322304
 could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections? to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?" elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said, "you are mistaken, Mr darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner. 19.811969953042553
 he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. 3.589667335470833
 only let me assure you, my dear miss elizabeth, that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. 7.296518531872275
 but don't imagine it was from any silly cause. 2.0106649286682643
 she is grown so brown and coarse! louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again. 4.713155802675426
" "i am not now to learn," replied Mr collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time. 13.932838480599337
" the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while. 16.73077940652661
 in the intervals of her discourse with Mrs collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. 14.751317944577595
 "i hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother inlaw a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers. 9.51489047583999
-"oh! Mr collins!"- "my dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point. 5.562751326153475
 in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew  more affection than she feels. 5.2573639697314745
" "you saw me dance at meryton, i believe, sir. 2.3485589429102913
 miss bingley was engrossed by Mr darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her. 20.900632836081794
 she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal. 15.191542765294107
 people  did say, you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but, however, i hope it is not true. 5.319710934276079
 her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them. 8.311615390439298
 almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life. 6.48633161324197
 her reflections were in general satisfactory. 1.9324110243316155
 miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte, and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself. 7.090623543736891
 she was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition. 6.254392623510989
" elizabeth made no answer. 1.0612896934111886
 the envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. 14.636635890658978
 Mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room. 8.015280748887633
 as her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. 5.4407894131011965
 it was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. 6.587952657345847
 elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband. 2.746972263384308
 i need not explain myself farther; and though  we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable. 13.218064915884947
 respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. 8.04651540594469

 do not distress me by the idea. 2.534271419044302
 and with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former  were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn. 10.287001458652249
 for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter. 3.118078243000495
 i defy even sir william lucas himself, to produce a more valuable son inlaw. 2.2414236030745904
 Mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,- "this walk is not wide enough for our party. 4.9951593364080615
" then addressing her daughter, "oh! my dear, dear jane, i am so happy! i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night. 10.389528960592354
" "i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. 2.1523651296654562
 the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. 10.235232677828172
 even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. 5.018511790106011
" "oh! if that is all, i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better. 4.618560841457519
 she accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn, had by some accident been lost. 7.183979505737084
 i do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain. 3.3240328899016554
" "Mr collins moreover adds," "i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known. 8.510084519966613
" "that is right. 1.0177412542018482
 painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. 5.54490373057018
 he then said, "i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. 3.9627559545315725
" "it is from miss bingley," said jane, and then read it aloud. 2.6377189620848913
 "kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room. 2.9659437308887555
 your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather. 5.549141953652381
" their party in the dining room was large, for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her. 35.479007759535875
" "heaven forbid!- that would be the greatest misfortune of all! to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! do not wish me such an evil. 9.958950039889201
 "i am, dear sir, &c. 4.475135221839895
 what could be the meaning of it? it was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know. 7.38687438943839
" she then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street, where Mr hurst had a house. 11.044735002161222
 Mr collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. 3.0007986225628995
" "have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?" "oh! yes. 2.1657949432768255
 "we can all plague and punish one another. 6.5754317920436804
" "perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often. 3.5736113348294016
" this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret. 3.3582474299768434
 he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia, to send any message to her. 5.145009148039856
 of Mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. 6.548872196946642
" "i desire you will do no such thing. 2.8332969473339755
" she burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word. 4.734044669056331
" "your first position is false. 1.777839841773466
 i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. 5.709970063698468
 i am very, very sorry. 4.828202006968415
 i will have no reserves from  you. 1.3073545588542157
 from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how  he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. 8.13048324751718
 after wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation. 20.788116370784046

" "and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?" "how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. 8.905064818720861
 it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. 5.763284025725292
 you have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule. 3.8886087142034786
 with a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round. 2.7431470473763517
 her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. 6.929829409917557

 elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane, on their first arrival at lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere. 18.31998855157788
" "you are then resolved to have him?" "i have said no such thing. 3.2601017228259823
 with a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. 8.5970300465009
 i wish you had been there. 2.8800578091767934
 let me hear from you very soon. 2.3067263079619753
 we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. 2.7157098085213547
 it was agreed to. 1.1237125530882246
" "Mr darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried elizabeth. 4.12898197571607
" "i believe her to be both in a great degree," replied wickham; "i have not seen her for many years, but i very well remember that i never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. 6.766372641590411
 she stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. 4.965375672866147
 i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. 7.7232061490757955

 Mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old. 4.789493333411674

 jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. 5.88126885721102
 lady catherine rose also, and they turned back. 1.5530873427619347
 as she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr darcy, and Mr darcy only, entered the room. 19.44348762752665
 elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. 7.295338364470285
 bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. 11.320494284034783
 well, i was so frightened i did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. 7.549910815380785

" "though it is difficult," said jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit. 9.771943584501669
 i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield. 3.3493054181185538
 he absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility. 8.560008913299605
 colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings. 3.7541102456994064

 in the absence of jane, he always attached himself to elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of relief. 8.070359436233723
 it is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining. 4.0713029649158505
 by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. 15.570747731513432
 his affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her. 12.796093560672094
 but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. 3.4619504317947087

" elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room. 3.2978248838070674
 but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham. 9.474845603997624
 i was in the middle before i knew that i  had begun. 3.5292093985005986
 they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. 16.46123815753858
 long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided. 3.5124181009891204
 elizabeth now began to revive. 2.1074637598375876
 but on returning to the drawing room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. 8.389157244860185
 Mr wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat a salutation which Mr darcy just deigned to return. 6.639448215573474
 to the little town of lambton, the scene of Mrs gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of lambton, elizabeth found from her aunt, that pemberley was situated. 15.370139266133174
 but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you. 4.353143077506787
 elizabeth was disgusted, and even miss bennet was shocked. 2.213976660112053
 caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did i receive in the mean time. 10.980084069030966
" "she is a very fine looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well. 6.65308982368292
 it is every way horrible!" darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence. 4.1283422373632686
 four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister. 4.849899336096557
 "it is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. 7.721030378977724
 the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. 7.038542793392079
" "you are mistaken. 1.002421963089355
" "when i wrote that letter," replied darcy, "i believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit. 5.464882209040234
 her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill judged thing in the world! how strange must it appear to him! in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! oh! why did she come? or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. 23.08044550455364
 upon the whole, i am much pleased with him. 2.685965807457576
 Mrs bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. 2.5593806434548223
 elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied. 8.49801351355358
 they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. 3.4086548524073272

" "i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. 8.623929475335201
" and rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr collins thus addressed her, "when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character. 22.558437514893527
 i am perfectly serious in my refusal. 1.1972486436041505
 i quite detest the man. 3.2211734457464867
 he has been accused of many faults at different times; but  this is the true one. 4.409749254660942
 i shall never forget her appearance this morning. 1.918344206676526
 her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her. 2.8937846762628108
" "not as you represent it. 2.929020272591063
 the present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from  that, though elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware, that, had she known nothing of darcy, she could have borne the dread of lydia's infamy somewhat better. 13.424344429917202
 she complained bitterly of all this to her husband. 5.508623550904952
 Mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them. 9.306535832754053
 miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard. 3.8462361104428604
 she is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but i will  make her know it. 3.7994881963181975
 she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. 2.0906859191623934
" elizabeth turned away to hide a smile. 2.4169506810810915
 there was no want of discourse. 1.1922043395027586
 "indeed, Mr bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that i should be forced to make way for  her, and live to see her take my place in it!" "my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. 11.32766694558916
 it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night. 3.8436090523371536
 but these are not jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. 3.221741547328116

 upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. 4.497215334880042
 the rest of the evening passed with the  appearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again. 10.982912431928176
 darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. 5.511144526145802
 he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest. 4.876038128476709
 the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. 3.371261966169441
 lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention. 4.294202209348209
 Mr collins was eloquent in her praise. 1.6378601102195507
 you see on what a footing we are. 3.359237494179308
 their powers of conversation were considerable. 2.9330952512971185
 but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. 3.3700763085337395
" "did you go by the village of kympton?" "i do not recollect that we did. 2.993600101193505
 at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. 5.1436121555162595
 i rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. 5.059557592633805
 Mrs hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr darcy's eyes were fixed on her. 9.895600568468355
 the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend. 19.55033915637073
 to my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men. 3.659750059580997
 there are few people whom i really love, and still fewer of whom i think well. 3.83822888071927
 my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of of Mr wickham. 8.813561491169768
 oh! how acutely did she now feel it. 2.1158884365065656
 on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. 5.88045496233841
 he had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. 20.807012626699716
 bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. 2.5670235695378296
 charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding, "i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility. 11.253730937893643
 when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. 6.8659278981022585
 "i began to be afraid you would never come back again. 2.56194351887216
 they talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs gardiner thought of him, and Mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject. 15.303939135868406
 why jane you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see Mr bingley. 8.599278427352882
 your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from Mr wickham. 3.1354165139455974
 she had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. 13.507857749374178
 Mrs bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. 5.043825249905924
 you are all to come to pemberley at christmas. 4.137476058420364
 she was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. 4.5189870397881595
 wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in london, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. 6.787824245516445
 "i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas. 6.702739602595483
 Mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character. 12.532797377707777
 "so, lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love i find. 4.775153648186463
 her look and manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and i remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. 9.821620017728765
 you tear them to pieces. 2.6253901964139867
 their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. 4.217174271321071
 the other is miss de bourgh. 1.4636612544686283
 but we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. 2.7231549260895918
 Mrs collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home. 9.081393770320869
" but jane could think with certainty on only one point, that Mr bingley, if he  had  been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public. 9.433184413145147
 he, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. 7.894196576744017
 remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin. 9.592118028689978
 they have some of the finest woods in the country. 2.668969945156667
 he still loves me, and we are engaged. 1.8508699376766256
 the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment. 13.579518363650461
 i see the imprudence of it. 1.746138204294192
 the gardiners staid a week at longbourn; and what with the philipses, the lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. 6.365790339404795
" on miss lucas's persevering, however, she added, "very well; if it must be so, it must. 5.608806756051432
 "it certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr bennet, "and nothing can clear Mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn. 7.994162856619391
" but Mr gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters. 13.657690880643887
 jane was distressed. 1.1965950964091292
 you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. 11.012123431191672
 kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for Mr collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton. 11.673765882388247
" this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. 6.284420475403383
 i was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her. 3.540871605401752
 in understanding darcy was the superior. 2.329138980093103
" "my dear jane!" exclaimed elizabeth, "you are too good. 2.441239815166181
 it is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side. 5.669021735001935
 bingley was the principal spokesman, and miss bennet the principal object. 3.6119983791955566
 i must confess myself surprised by your application; i did not expect it from  you. 2.402723853298714
 "i should like to know how he behaves among strangers. 2.62076706809321
 she got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour. 6.014104259702346
 but you have chosen your fault well. 1.449514409783061
 in a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account. 5.222806256012927
" elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together. 2.62551999224982
 oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!" "oh! my dear," continued Mrs bennet, "i am quite delighted with him. 6.143907098672262
" the girls stared at their father. 1.8202631721954796
 she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. 7.982595290426925
 i will take care of myself, and of Mr wickham too. 4.74236597169891
 "nay," said elizabeth, "this is not fair. 2.3880681974901643
 i am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs f. 2.9279636700005054
 i do not know the particulars, but i know very well that Mr darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. 12.307040327022499
" chapter xiii. 1.004510325792807
" "who do you mean, my dear? i know of nobody that is coming i am sure, unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in, and i hope  my dinners are good enough for her. 9.427928551757322
 every thing nourishes what is strong already. 4.169362485898849
 that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. 7.980994400258038
 and you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner. 5.579717645753399
" "her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament. 12.356335545257142
 i cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. 11.132692763959529
 lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. 13.00041002536747
 she was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation. 3.4869084594647672
 every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane. 3.501270010278589
" "oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption! and, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road. 8.814843884869816
 if your feelings are still what they were last april, tell me so at once. 8.105205110470482
 i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are packed up. 4.617886945090815

 their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party. 4.230902604933475
 i always said it must be so, at last. 3.0301461892010617
 she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. 9.650721392051324
 it is a pity they are not handsome! not that  i think charlotte so  very plain but then she is our particular friend. 8.062090891864829
 he had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than  we had; and the consciousness of this, was another reason for his resolving to follow us. 8.711225228444462
 you alluded to something else. 1.8003600874792483
 a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. 6.648000240133672
 he is gone to my father already. 1.3614605986445436
" the gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where miss bennet was making tea, and elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair. 14.435128617330971
 elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "i have never had a cross word from him in my life, and i have known him ever since he was four years old. 7.017474174198492
 you know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends. 2.9552693565024923
 "i am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper i ever met with. 14.23078887097788
 i thought too ill of him, to invite him to pemberley, or admit his society in town. 4.76422387274568
" "you shall have it in few words. 2.7007324674470703
 yes, yes. 1.2224782707868205
 " you want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it. 3.519423158060438

 are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?" "oh, yes! you will only think i feel  more than i ought to do, when i tell you all. 10.069112290804803
 but the case is this. 2.015938657638136
 colonel forster came yesterday, having left brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. 4.714235854089
 his revenge would have been complete indeed. 2.6084341234568518
 it does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours. 9.525547582338588
 they were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them. 3.490838040962173
 the suspicions which had just arisen of Mr darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. 12.918934906897457
 this was very amiable, but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of Mr collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself. 14.412228610976332
 tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. 6.149939564461833
 much as i respect them, i believe, i thought only of  you. 5.393108957776026
 let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied. 3.5230978189696445
 a scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation. 8.176908672708674
 Mr darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings. 6.78068239427034
" "do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?" "sometimes. 4.542665071573206
 and in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away. 4.086202402379404
" "that is to say, you had given your permission. 2.1441812344331193
 the fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. 7.0598102247186505
 a lively imagination soon settled it all. 1.91418170147817
" "it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them. 5.161738537028167
" "what, none of you?" "not one. 3.071387242069802
 as it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery. 9.510779922477957
 well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr stone. 12.22758359641229
 jane was by no means better. 1.445452120213843
 Mr wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. 8.73451001902085
 he was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. 9.030343836475515
 she will be down in a moment i dare say. 1.558230916621866
 her power was sinking; every thing  must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. 5.726213120524096
" "she did indeed, louisa. 2.23462684877277
" elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. 10.2038935429552
" elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate. 8.810504189383694
 yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête àtête was over. 5.7148031221421425
" Mr darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter. 3.8136083690929494
 "i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried jane. 3.300458174306406
" it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. 4.975253106562928
 by Mrs hurst and miss bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. 13.515998304678968
 could she have seen half as much love in Mr darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. 6.314031732926949
" miss bennet still looked all amazement. 1.7112082795869359
 when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous. 5.182193283490929
 "if i," said Mr collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. 13.048381895178219
 on this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. 19.344411666141458
 the others have been gone on to scarborough, these three weeks. 4.461688265965404
 "there is also one other person in the party," he continued after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you, will you allow me, or do i ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton?" the surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. 15.575807696979172
 for herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. 2.4937903235545367
 they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family. 10.031359576274335
 "how despicably have i acted!" she cried. 7.36614559288058
 your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. 2.007245563062913
 "could i expect it to be otherwise!" said she. 2.0729614215217564
 i cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family. 7.668027471597892
" "it did. 1.0242466923268805
 and what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?" "she is a most charming young lady indeed. 6.637584093782289
 these causes must be stated, though briefly. 1.5293561080257103
 i am confident that she would have performed delightfully. 1.494952381373517
" "yes; i do comprehend a great deal in it. 2.1061374591741377
 miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. 6.690394326168984
 i was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. 4.380712849960349
 it was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them. 4.280772478457391
 i am perfectly satisfied. 1.1130004487424507
 i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. 2.2012253246053706
 but why Mr darcy came so often to the parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. 5.195691907381264
 when she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my sister inlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. 6.454149520974387
 she knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour. 3.981711415139494
 some people call him proud; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it. 2.4396893155506167
 at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner. 5.789854906987247
 chapter xi. 1.0
 elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "lord, how tired i am!" accompanied by a violent yawn. 7.538465380536253
 she had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. 5.104620583130359
 he repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence. 3.700477844481136
 when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her having two men servants go with her. 6.286592985007069
 he looked serious as usual; and she thought, more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at pemberley. 5.565695474825234
 they agreed that Mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. 11.101025326637794
" "but my father cannot. 1.2252796862897326
 "how near it may be to  mine, i cannot pretend to say. 3.4573550202898837
 it was all conjecture. 1.7388742032158013
 it was to this effect: "since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well. 9.127078578405639
 but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising. 4.206194647545198
 i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow. 4.981203955958784
 there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him. 7.6616582944725815
 elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. 3.3705691798290736
 i thought i should have broke my heart. 1.6511715492833612
 the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right. 10.144179073557506
 but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede. 4.944551781880041

 the rector of a parish has much to do. 1.68275772966798
 haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. 3.448156261707783
 elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits. 2.647297904431026
 she was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. 6.23635832509468
 i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. 3.006976109411873
 i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister. 13.404670984368584
" "i did not think you would; and that being the case, i cannot consider your situation with much compassion. 4.281781717830656
 i should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire. 3.2267251055286432
 elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr darcy and herself. 14.32787249608388
 she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr wickham, and rejoiced in it. 6.007185088888094
 you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. 5.373780623279731
 "i have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. 3.5730765255165746
 the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each. 19.325386341604922
 elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. 1.3649142343645184
 she had ventured only one glance at darcy. 1.819516390880939
" "no why should he? if it was not allowable for him to gain  my affections, because i had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?" "but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event. 12.84662964748004
" "has she been presented? i do not remember her name among the ladies at court. 2.650560680325488
" "i am grieved, indeed," cried darcy; "grieved shocked. 3.328392269348203
 but she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife. 15.98575358581945
 it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in london, than in scotland. 7.374064653311312
 her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. 2.7281308990785282
" "miss bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be. 2.2049756034249324
 it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy. 2.43800610010172
" "ah!" cried Mrs bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls. 5.085141957550614
" "and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. 3.6010364502076575
" "and men take care that they should. 1.5109605499617988
 his friend had left him that morning for london, but was to return home in ten days time. 4.4512290262815215
 miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other. 7.054647356582916
" Mr gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from colonel forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. 3.965618683066108
 it was really a very handsome thought. 2.8326666802329816
 Mr collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. 12.776537549715291
 she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater what shall i call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. 6.433005452698489
 Mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton. 3.7414246726284897
 your father would depend on  your resolution and good conduct, i am sure. 1.9900869366407883
 bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. 3.500798405293211
 the whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him. 5.036633964235814
 her ease and good spirits increased. 1.7349907226353896
" "and mary king is safe!" added elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune. 4.083285882938914

 it is because he will not give himself the trouble. 2.7857121058485563
 he bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr darcy, with an expression of half laughing alarm. 7.764472354346568
 "if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield," said Mrs bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, i shall have nothing to wish for. 5.130461533188072
 when at length they arose to take leave, Mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. 14.685135546817902
 "and pray may i ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "is it in address that he improves? has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style? for i dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials. 15.068408413116519

 your sister i also watched. 3.5140794328574474
 poor lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful. 6.493230345080566
" "upon my word i say no more  here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except netherfield. 4.537598114669144
 your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed him to act as he has done. 5.670569260786469
 their mutual affection will steady them; and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten. 11.001746989832982
" "yes, sir; but i do not know when  that will be. 3.597968021872317
 i shall go distracted. 2.838843751877889
" then taking the disengaged arm of Mr darcy, she left elizabeth to walk by herself. 6.236134644159981
 "they will join me early to morrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you, Mr bingley and his sisters. 7.80632930329527
 Mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. 7.2314525556494615
 elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. 4.760694020518335

 it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind. 18.906835570278275

 but there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure. 4.945335260422956
 elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and even jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when if they had gone to scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them. 16.98959350086353

 the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street. 12.60125307278988

 that she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. 12.948347938083781

" elizabeth shook her head over this letter. 1.7056933702548298
 they repulsed every attempt of Mrs bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr collins, who was complimenting Mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. 16.946658916551332
 when Mr bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure. 5.061364070411028
 Mrs gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder. 4.977134208148202
 there is nothing else to be done. 1.2534917439648163
 it was as follows: "my dear sir, "i feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire. 11.805155839985924

 and if you will stay another  month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london, for i am going there early in june, for a week; and as dawson does not object to the barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, i should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large. 21.30677924540391
 but these things happen so often! a young man, such as you describe Mr bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent. 12.289380278653747
 elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. 2.7758838662542176
 Mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both. 5.128986328203516
" "you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society; and indeed i am quite of your opinion. 4.844037710181294
" my mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at easter, i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis de bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england. 16.750188981786973

 i am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. 3.147926932600207

" "you have a house in town, i conclude?" Mr darcy bowed. 2.8406896963876536
 "well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband? is not he a charming man? i am sure my sisters must all envy me. 7.539559048328417

 "she looks sickly and cross. 1.275013653895556
 her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth, as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. 9.770562472139504
 Mrs gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late Mr darcy by character perfectly well. 6.995640628828438
 but i must write no more. 1.3035540196462154
 elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. 14.247002509442083
 "no; but it must be done soon. 4.467785923720218
 that had his actions been what wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr bingley, was incomprehensible. 13.66934501392214
 "oh! my dear lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?" "oh, lord! i don't know. 5.419150875091092
 we were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. 5.065860987222415
 i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. 4.642886029845041
" elizabeth was forced to go. 1.0520743466683695
 "haye park might do," said she, "if the gouldings would quit it, or the great house at stoke, if the drawing room were larger; but ashworth is too far off! i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for purvis lodge, the attics are dreadful. 12.545930079405215
 anxiety on jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr darcy's explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what jane had lost. 10.782582509658678
 at length however Mrs bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. 10.857868934502626
 lydia was exceedingly fond of him. 1.107772989054538
 and as i come back, i can call on lady lucas and Mrs long. 3.864898974473748
" with a stronger voice she soon added, "i have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself. 6.458548169365587
" "that is exactly what i should have supposed of you," said elizabeth. 1.772289349608082
 it was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. 7.067327074753644
 but i hope you will not mind it: it is all for jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. 6.650740589507384

 the pause was to elizabeth's feelings dreadful. 2.4894740762629293
 when the party broke up, lydia returned with Mrs forster to meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. 10.25724148796213
 by all that i have ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. 11.589598162376156
 my dear, dear lydia! how merry we shall be together when we meet!" her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr gardiner's behaviour laid them all under. 9.128507545579934
 "what will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are! he takes them now for people of fashion. 7.782763152797838
 i was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance. 10.083668686315631
 the note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. 3.597302644903257
 "it was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as his marriage was fixed on. 4.371655630369714

 having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity. 24.697819258855073

 Mr bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. 15.38706771400482

 the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! he had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. 40.13693381425956

 that he was really fond of jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations. 13.487482338760096

 how grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family! when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful. 21.08428698147386
" in spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. 6.65512312122573

 when the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party. 11.25808712030946
 she did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that  she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. 21.200050554805802
 to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther. 26.543632555908328
 had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?" as she pronounced these words, Mr darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued. 19.66217739984838
 "can you come to morrow?" yes, he had no engagement at all for to morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity. 4.70689309131232

 it was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain. 10.439188851016981
 however, i recollected afterwards, that if he  had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr darcy might have done as well. 7.018402276240066
" to these high flown expressions, elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent Mr bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his. 20.981145111218364
" "lady catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use. 5.285272565857538
 lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten; every sister except mary agreed to go with her; and Mr collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at hunsford. 29.27239336947631
" Mr collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter. 7.028931661247668

 the children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them, playing with them, and loving them. 20.267641668758518
 Mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it. 1.743209755595601

 all were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and kitty and lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot. 17.750265630740284

 while sir william was with them, Mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road. 22.200677965209252

 mary and kitty were both with Mrs bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all. 11.202922728240052
 many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if  he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia's connections, which is not likely, can i suppose her so lost to every thing? impossible. 10.446022553623955
 he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. 11.134506934443776
 his behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father. 12.008549564387222
 so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to  his easy temper, or  her affectionate heart. 6.432234458346602
 i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, lizzy?" elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible. 5.311604863167338
 when the ladies returned to the drawing room, there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted. 13.45145112953219
 i do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and i am sure if i had been you, i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it. 7.313690712088017
 Mr collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. 3.4767849104948776

 Mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet. 7.790805061912434
" "no more have i," said Mr bennet; "and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you. 8.136188358984892
 but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon. 3.5331220779335597
 Mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard. 20.148468609616703
" the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. 18.95906321672776

 elizabeth was not surprised at it, as jane had written the direction remarkably ill. 3.6927084834884645
 Mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield, in the course of three or four months. 10.459790496402618

" he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend. 18.031016213078246

 she saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family. 10.46634621099244
 my youngest of all, is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man, who i believe will soon become a part of the family. 8.936268177734485

" "can you possibly guess, lizzy, who is meant by this?" "this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire, splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. 10.31045960515924
 they had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring. 13.173836654542635
 it was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting  when she had seen him last in hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed, "how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november, Mr darcy! it must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, he went but the day before. 19.5204805864512
 but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents. 8.168247232475531
" "probably not; but Mr darcy can please where he chuses. 9.181233509040887
" miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. 4.595866869231342
" he then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. 6.2996008390432365
 she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley. 2.488804691644207
 she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. 11.529592265235433
 she had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. 9.056508169850229

 he made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. 3.24340998233493
 your ladyship wants Mr darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished for promise, make  their marriage at all more probable? supposing him to be attached to me, would  my refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? allow me to say, lady catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged. 21.070293211863426
 since the  shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. 6.2545345788134865
 as for elizabeth, her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards  one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. 16.126633033074064
 miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with  them, was expressed towards the two eldest. 11.58033359939508
 their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the collinses' reach. 5.6177653222497925

 they were off saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. 6.022959614376404
 the rain continued the whole evening without intermission; jane certainly could not come back. 3.9033372528689587
 Mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july, and must be in london again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than derbyshire. 25.513263993633725

 poor charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. 7.6491186552031145
 if, indeed, it should be so! but i dare not hope it. 7.602872252970367
 elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last. 8.834601532146177
 after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow jane to deceive herself no longer. 13.633654045591516
 pray, what is your age?" "with three younger sisters grown up," replied elizabeth smiling, "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it. 5.159031499462595
 she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who often joined them, and good naturedly engaged Mr collins's conversation to herself. 7.339433444215117
 while settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her. 9.101077858320586
" "his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said elizabeth angrily; "for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr darcy's steward, and of  that, i can assure you, he informed me himself. 15.259282598184054
" "oh, yes. 1.1382104219763403
 his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear. 3.701005906742831
 it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. 7.896065052683535
 Mr wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia. 5.672753198238676
 i told Mrs collins so before you came. 10.19019489332558
 "and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr gardiner. 8.567098229638834
 when the ladies removed after dinner, elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. 10.724271587024377
 but jane was to go home with her, and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation. 4.725884230380805

 "yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! i  will leave him to himself. 8.489687256998803
 the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be. 5.887593492038222
 on saturday he came again. 1.3087165157233247
 after walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home. 7.098043179541968
 but my feelings are not only cordial towards  him; they are even impartial towards miss king. 4.560754964949165
 there was no help for it however. 2.574456296077246
 but do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr darcy?" "they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine. 9.534384218640886
" "is it possible!" cried elizabeth, when she had finished. 1.723527072159873
" "let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility. 1.8712053589039055
 elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. 4.914774266577339
 she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room. 6.488290817177021
 and when you have given  your ball," she added, "i shall insist on their giving one also. 3.7186416325815883
 i only hope they may have half my good luck. 2.9438006119726943
 elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur. 9.292043049467162
" "upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. 3.7026683164339023
" "but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?" "it does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. 8.16414884893444
 but i am at his disposal. 1.4377082329521438
 besides, there was truth in his looks. 3.185121060283651
 the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. 2.8836844491417004
 Mr gardiner declared his willingness, and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation. 4.313682395361393
" "and  your defect is a propensity to hate every body. 2.065530604615982
 send back your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. 6.629733927831475
 is this to be endured! but it must not, shall not be. 4.898971863482338
 her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms. 7.29896300600774
 elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation. 7.444014673026729
" "not so hasty, if you please. 1.3723433770131976
 Mrs bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces. 6.898141608513939
" "how can you contrive to write so even?" he was silent. 2.841046748385489
 more thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed. 7.103765962506578
 perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been  that in his voice, which was not like ease. 7.484371719361894
 she put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success. 8.432850757675899
 but there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good natured wishes for her well doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain. 19.153948167549085
 "indeed, jane, you ought to believe me. 4.067050162861714
 when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses. 3.6002969876819706
" "Mr darcy is all politeness," said elizabeth, smiling. 3.5715443473529183
 i have suspected it some time, but i am now convinced. 3.390141233669989
 and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman. 4.289667188898836
 Mrs gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs bennet and Mrs philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces. 12.53643177152075
 your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters. 3.351877530822803
 her answer was warmly in his favour. 1.347603253533613
" elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. 1.6256406304732463
" his daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north, received at first an absolute negative. 7.623406244969695
 that he was  surprised by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr gardiner. 13.468540764248846
 from his garden, Mr collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while sir william accompanied him, charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help. 17.610808332247338
" "but does lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand?" "oh, yes! that, that is the worst of all. 8.464266315491901
" "whatever my connections may be," said elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to  you. 4.845558550480694
 the officers of the  shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as  they were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room. 25.687793254190392

 his wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind. 3.5174934988142352
 a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme. 11.683991445938535
 there was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning. 7.126726668002254
 she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. 17.927662966444796

 she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it. 4.506411350130707
 who is to fight wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?" as Mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to london, at the same time that Mr bennet came from it. 12.775054135738165

 the sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage. 10.862296582671272
 i was sometimes quite provoked, but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. 7.223314977438594

" "money! my uncle!" cried jane, "what do you mean, sir?" "i mean, that no man in his senses, would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after i am gone. 9.180658521830255

 when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. 7.008943499072065
 she was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham, a fortnight before they took place. 8.09158347523919
 towards  him i have been kinder than towards myself. 3.660303615247605
 with what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs bingley and talked of Mrs darcy may be guessed. 8.98506662946567
- that is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter. 8.393348714878606

 but whatever may be the sentiments which Mr wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character. 5.999490644135748
 on the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. 4.144219971981696
 she was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be killed. 7.199842179397404

" "and then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books. 4.875120708892147
" as it happened that elizabeth had  much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind. 8.196024839227517
 one morning, about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. 11.513868110680546
" "well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? if he had not had a family of his own, i and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents. 14.424300697101835
 from their infancy, they have been intended for each other. 1.7563671722770566
" "you may depend upon it, madam," said miss bingley, with cold civility, "that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us. 4.075553820859442
 "my dearest child," she cried, "i can think of nothing else! ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'tis as good as a lord! and a special licence. 6.792154065674243
 jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs. 15.288997138491377
 lydia, my love, though you  are the youngest, i dare say Mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball. 6.650124110989338
 "what can be the meaning of this!" said charlotte, as soon as he was gone. 2.9613089064669027
 that will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him. 7.0574557263412805
 Mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. 5.8196973448391205
" "that is not an unnatural surmise," said fitzwilliam, "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly. 5.277644439082882
 with  them he is remarkably agreeable. 1.5733927429980814
" elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. 4.124676495000705
 her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. 18.034489845445894
" " you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet. 5.741536461457319
 but, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, i am determined. 4.542588883873545
 she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. 7.729006721903729
" "upon my word! well, that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however, it may all come to nothing you know. 9.637372286459806
 lady lucas herself has often said so, and envied me jane's beauty. 6.330306165861547
 as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr collins's scruples of leaving Mr and Mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing room, that Mr wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house. 21.954166119133202
 she was wild to be at home to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe. 19.137771929767837
 gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. 15.265533988389821
 two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. 11.10164957188404
 if you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up. 3.871665651021715
 "you are joking, lizzy. 1.4244293340627603
 i want to be told whether i ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham's character. 4.620646812213373
 whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr collins, was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr bennet were dead. 13.515163173232448
 who  could about such a nasty little freckled thing?" elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of  expression herself, the coarseness of the  sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal! as soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and lydia's purchases, were seated in it. 27.551059000700302
 he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way. 5.543036730604939
 we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton. 1.9805698238673592
 and so, my dear sister, i find from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen pemberley. 5.559664992083075
 something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life. 4.138235622124443
 perhaps i am not doing her justice. 1.6161556699631985
 the dejection was almost universal. 1.8936326486257378
 as soon as they entered the copse, lady catherine began in the following manner:- "you can be at no loss, miss bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither. 4.465059903154057
" "but you see that jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt. 3.312324720979807
" "i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party. 4.721844717634879
 i will only say farther, that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection. 7.528605158260536
 Mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. 7.801160458208048
 elizabeth was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes. 7.869687334500158
 miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. 4.922629331145907
 "if i had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to brighton, with all my family,  this would not have happened; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her. 5.0483220811825
" "to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it? it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum. 12.547538237315448

" elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. 9.498396775193862
" Mr darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh. 4.004729764232966
 in a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. 3.201951835775841
 however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. 13.266940797218757
 at that moment, she cared for no other. 2.1204778492127465
 Mrs collins will be very glad of your company, i am sure. 1.9937323639487627
 at present i will not say more, but perhaps when we are better  acquainted" he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. 4.388400228458218
 she retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse. 7.41208042999713
 their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp. 29.782741668815415
 such doings discomposed Mr bennet exceedingly. 4.844614218500178
 had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself. 13.934984551720566
" "did not you?  i did for you. 4.245157363381071
 but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?" elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning. 11.2213709927048
 do your sisters play and sing?" "one of them does. 3.3775211832424037
 such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them. 5.870470623767789
 she certainly did not hate him. 1.6360379472825393
 it is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. 3.1425459936160856
 miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr darcy's progress through  his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. 8.797203432629939
 on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. 4.253985721374299

 "but what is to be done about pemberley?" cried Mrs gardiner. 4.366046460808389
" "is this a hint to me, lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?" "no, indeed. 4.234836558806292

 of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough. 10.022198437698595
 they shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super excellent disposition of jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself. 22.220969321269273

" "i might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? was not this some excuse for incivility, if i  was uncivil? but i have other provocations. 13.845436760298433
 and then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!" to this, mary very gravely replied, "far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures. 17.606058422568626
" her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than elizabeth. 7.612113795624559
 it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr darcy's proposals. 5.891221822489683
 if it be not so, let Mr darcy contradict it. 12.819848589692008

 his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit. 11.647837048070835
 he enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done. 8.575809800056506
 you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy. 8.601270170806876

 Mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else. 9.688301295951232

 even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr wickham; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday, could have made such a friday, saturday, sunday and monday, endurable to kitty and lydia. 12.450007230438251

 elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the fairest way for happiness. 8.94284608864349
 Mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on george wickham, who was his god son, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. 13.25359388204801

 Mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane; but as he took up his abode with the lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs bennet. 7.588710815407746
 "implacable resentment  is a shade in a character. 2.4903605167262444
 you wanted me, i know, to say 'yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. 13.025220868533347
 she saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once. 21.19793765266601
 jane could have no reserves from elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world. 8.02364575464122

 his pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable, allowing something for fortune and figure. 15.36480490138214
" "i thank you for my share of the favour," said elizabeth; "but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands. 3.9270056104198834
 that lady i suppose is your mother. 2.7345175849515946
 these parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not. 10.323865830812206
 the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning; and Mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings. 20.902324136836704
" "are they indeed?" cried elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction. 1.8024092682530528
 i pity, though i cannot help blaming her. 2.7231447933918753
 they look upon it quite as their own, i dare say, whenever that happens. 5.339182890445303
 an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. 8.566813355456643
 "she is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration. 5.432465471223649

 to the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. 10.118389145000899
 from what he said of miss darcy, i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. 3.3065549611583553

 my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying Mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did. 6.618269283907776
 soon after their return, a letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and was opened immediately. 5.183250851317909
 there is nothing he would not do for her. 2.2268986160851103
" "not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise. 2.8275033057107506
 but when the gentlemen entered, jane was no longer the first object. 6.428856509544847

 the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way. 10.140917305385651
 the distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. 4.477951704648058
 during dinner, Mr bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. 10.741133384108023
 from something that he told me in our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him. 3.8683945626781324
 i am happier even than jane; she only smiles, i laugh. 5.164686156635065
 "excuse my interference. 1.0949519929281915
 the letter was to this effect: "my dear lizzy, "i wish you joy. 1.9948532688123948
 but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley. 3.279610899614684
 she was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr darcy and herself. 12.277079441783153
 he knows where we live. 1.3271741696478978
 she felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained. 13.287738060438617
" she could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success. 4.654997888159831
 then, the two third he danced with miss king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the  boulanger" "if he had had any compassion for  me," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! for god's sake, say no more of his partners. 16.882481738393615
 he placed himself by her. 1.3720528850083882
" lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said, "i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. 9.185521790590666
 in truth i must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings. 7.948466019281731
 her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. 2.2693630780652465
 my visit was not long, as caroline and Mrs hurst were going out. 3.531840687596297
 after walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. 7.4293709170695115
 but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed. 6.012686247032458
 "very well. 1.0
 the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield. 2.8041219490341907
 his arrival was soon known at the parsonage, for Mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. 13.227481799780785
 but self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. 4.8798049145496885
 a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love. 15.640251476217204
" "yes, indeed," cried Mrs bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. 3.4818951252997143
 but think no more of the letter. 1.396432584540942
 he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. 3.416640641199604

 you refuse, then, to oblige me. 3.5805331835468475
 the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of lady catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough. 14.839999952738603

 let me know every thing that i am to know, without delay. 3.158949592099682
 allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr darcy. 11.990885798542205
 when Mr collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten. 7.5952481867329
 sir william lucas, and his daughter maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. 13.92666150696492
 but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving home. 4.142750527871797

 miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. 4.282666666966549
 he who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. 19.240014026128
 she seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her. 6.442388992887824

 if  i can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too. 3.9268498850108933
 what a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received! he was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. 14.646841276403116

 they were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of pemberley might be something! they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned. 14.79444786528984

" to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female. 16.11434274291313
 "i hope, my dear," said Mr bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to day, because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party. 8.515531753877791
" lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. 12.252213918421859
 Mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. 8.513024722396981
 she could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. 7.314750022272776
 to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said, "i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal. 6.794218209419435

 my objections to the marriage were not merely those, which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. 10.57542267145583
 four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival. 2.3424442370646466

 elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known sir william's too long. 4.288200332733262
 Mrs gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on: "you are too sensible a girl, lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, i am not afraid of speaking openly. 11.07946241696435
 i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. 12.235039144236692

 Mr philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. 3.584836385677578
 i told him, moreover, that i believed myself mistaken in supposing, as i had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, i felt no doubt of their happiness together. 8.920229941835885
" she then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. 6.150283911863314
 she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia, and, removed from the influence of lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. 16.121325432804397

 lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. 5.09479910074865

 he stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to elizabeth again, he walked away. 6.5996300912068815
 Mrs bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could. 9.640832817706382
 it drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. 6.992535078619994
 as for your elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?" "it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied. 14.15608232367212

 it soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before. 14.33677597700205
" "this is quite shocking! he deserves to be publicly disgraced. 1.5622577429205888
 the whole of what elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter. 10.180201862962862
 my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner, one, whom his father had promised to provide for. 10.666041442525415

 between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. 6.232509388712559
 we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend, the certain evils of such a choice. 5.613734016186338
 Mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope, that by the following christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office, another regiment should be quartered in meryton. 21.018456338509584

 elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? catherine, weak spirited, irritable, and completely under lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and lydia, self willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. 13.696853541792724
 were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain. 1.7004356060743626
" "but if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. 3.0039292719141555

 intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done. 4.211185869788545
 so far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great. 4.792394141937517
" elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. 6.7330103468179425
" another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment. 5.321276854033728
 why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?" "why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear. 9.821744203807464
 in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which jane was equally eager to satisfy. 5.4200747855347124
" but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. 12.464468572631056
" she was gone directly. 1.1252556910936564
 the prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. 3.3670361690506683
 it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance. 12.373141485969155

" "i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful. 5.246888016603473
" jane then took it from her pocket book, and gave it to elizabeth. 3.146845572949545
 though Mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. 5.1802574622114435
 Mr collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. 10.395487277330098
 "that is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to  me to have many such acquaintance. 6.3601152251987125

 there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters. 5.165386823522452
" when the dancing recommenced, however, and darcy approached to claim her hand, charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. 13.775162935155805
 a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. 2.5215091545645176
" "it may do very well for the others," replied Mr bingley; "but i am sure it will be too much for kitty. 4.689033979211792
 Mr bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. 19.629187150986688
 the whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. 3.1757855801117807
 in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. 7.640442094489541
 lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. 3.296369322651766
 i knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine, frankly and openly. 8.838304550495767
 her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines. 3.7141086590083683
 she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. 4.035414110671724
 elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him. 8.113204878151766
 it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. 3.8295225038272234
 there could not exist in the world  two men, over whom Mr darcy could have such boundless influence. 10.706556668365547
" "take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment. 4.495493743513205

 it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. 18.43724990933709
" "your surprise could not be greater than  mine in being noticed by you. 2.7867537758213907
 such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! oh, my dear lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. 5.134518736448606
 she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions. 1.7716189748975997
 but here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized. 6.8151984336830616
 it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of  some, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible. 7.730724472742886
 a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of their  three months' acquaintance they had been intimate  two. 6.466236593854717
 would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress. 9.205953968401735
 but do not imagine that he is always here so often. 2.3833052971514324
 in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger. 6.114755411509768
" she held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house. 4.349958006248466
" "so much the better. 1.7807159255936604
 i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it; i believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as i wished it in reason. 7.015206807489185
 oh, brother, how kind you are! i know you will contrive it all. 5.761246394210536
 you must and shall be married by a special licence. 2.6680914489636907
 i must conclude, for i cannot be long from my poor mother. 2.091200923797547
 if elizabeth, when Mr darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. 6.153764623349287

 it would be dreadful! she blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk. 7.176610710282165
 lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but  he had never seen any thing but affability in her. 5.867172455525629
" "la!" replied kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before. 5.087022873479435
 "you have insulted me, in every possible method. 1.9674409872022616
 miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth. 13.441212291636637
 the account of his connection with the pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. 7.956262520052256
 for my part, i am inclined to believe it all Mr darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse. 6.914022856464486
 it is of all subjects my delight. 2.828466234376685
 her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying, "there are very few people of whom so much can be said. 7.253010618884627
 i know it cannot be long. 1.8487031605631132
 she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances: and to have Mr collins instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed. 14.17212513541576
 her carriage remained at the door, and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it. 3.824545295975629
 that is the place to get husbands. 2.16106588253144
 the same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening. 2.740738494316398
 elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from pemberley. 3.0450360899868945
" jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern. 2.8668479172460533
 "he only told me, what i have now told you. 3.60342069241816
 no one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection. 4.528783105312656
" her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the servants remained. 2.9532817466324244
" "she seems a very pleasant young woman," said bingley. 1.6259396597333315
 poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder. 3.0357323862897525
 he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true. 6.381714193245462
 you may remember what i told you on that point, when first we talked of it. 4.769362732266755
 the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and wickham, who happened to sit near elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. 9.1842470888107
 but that is one great difference between us. 2.4383594905582124

 "two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. 4.100395979153699
" "already arisen!" repeated Mr bennet. 3.1126192282981346
 his consenting to marry her is a proof, i will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. 7.7684301858132345
 he is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane. 3.577613466222126
 i have told miss bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as i have often told her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the piano forte in Mrs jenkinson's room. 11.712467655221491
 she comes to us to day. 1.7461290046586129
 she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr darcy. 7.849609586118167
 i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies. 2.8596971215069713
 i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent. 3.421417862457194

 Mr collins's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs bennet. 3.9782503716945805
 she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. 1.5029166699989662
" "if you  will thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone. 4.1231663226208415

 lydia the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern. 31.08856419050899
 for a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. 2.5913125948233904
 but are you pleased, jane? shall you like to have such a brother?" "very, very much. 6.973309338286226
 this Mrs younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. 9.430550968969685
 "it taught me to hope," said he, "as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. 4.026125683360005
 miss darcy, the daughter of Mr darcy, of pemberley, and lady anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. 7.662552418101759
" "is this," thought elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "and pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger son? unless the elder brother is very sickly, i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds. 12.866790972042365
 on the following monday, Mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn. 6.646423827115403

 "and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! oh, that i knew how it was!" but wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. 16.053969708029445
 oh! that i had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone. 5.476122529764297
 without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. 18.170763682141462
 "oh! my dear Mr bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. 6.490789533283552
 elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane, while Mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. 11.067314936313718
 here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell. 7.150433852978513
 proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself. 4.024504061585267
 had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. 4.407444933993751
 if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. 5.652995581819257
 elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement. 15.760540245234832
 thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business. 6.821487725687024
 "well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; i thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them. 12.3883717019378
 jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever. 6.778415419117937
 "he meant, i believe," replied jane, "to go to epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them. 6.463610500300022
 he wrote last week to hurry my return. 2.6544890923800044
 in a few minutes, Mrs bennet half opened the door and called out, "lizzy, my dear, i want to speak with you. 5.523271921917588
 the carriage was sent to meet them at -, and they were to return in it, by dinner time. 4.475516069746822
 the evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary. 2.4906645078592238
 elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion. 3.1441252557550787
 "i should never have said Mrs collins was settled  near her family. 3.260376525853429
 their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. 4.279741526023376
 he observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "it is above eight months. 13.087565478735032

 from the entrance hall, of which Mr collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti chamber, to the room where lady catherine, her daughter, and Mrs jenkinson were sitting. 20.508908272434063
 when her mother went up to her dressing room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication. 4.23106733791943
 Mr denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps. 12.093431815212055
 jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window she looked, she saw Mr darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister. 11.660979913308584
 she had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. 5.492349142599734
 it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way. 3.2178706552022667
 but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. 4.254403256304231
 but  your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. 9.289954797724771
 "i am afraid, Mr darcy," observed miss bingley, in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes. 7.253806759489288
 "i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. 5.784922066777294

 let me advise you then, my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence. 7.90178905464353
 he simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. 6.39653948352836
 he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it. 8.401913809356472
 when they had gained their own room, jane taking out the letter, said, "this is from caroline bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal. 8.595537652342108
" "you are quite right. 1.1913496762519118
 and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton, of whom i shall subjoin a list, according to his information. 7.148405967659013
 they walked towards the lucases, because kitty wished to call upon maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone. 8.29768760266145
 she asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name? elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly. 17.342845490761167
 lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so good humoured as lydia. 6.907870381963543
 but this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr darcy walk into the room. 8.201257986949384
 she was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr darcy, she was directly retreating. 13.173859299716234
" "now, kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife. 7.259433563392509
" "oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs bennet, "that is exactly what i could most wish for. 2.7723591387727655
 they then went away. 1.5712505918419397
 under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. 2.2006797977739314
 "he is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle. 2.631901872039756
" "i can much more easily believe Mr bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony. 9.645706751914556
 she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her. 11.01988549311935
 the favour of your company has been much felt, i assure you. 2.793418829882932
" this accounted to elizabeth for Mr wickham's being among them. 5.361962898056103
 sir william had been delighted with him. 1.310858429444349
 she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance. 6.875435858107864
 she followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly! "a man who has once been refused! how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!" she was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying, "is your sister at pemberley still?" "yes, she will remain there till christmas. 23.10375534605421
 but will they make you happy?" "have you any other objection," said elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?" "none at all. 5.550863512318996
 what did colonel forster say? had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place? they must have seen them together for ever. 3.741988184526284
 but it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly. 3.117640518124828
 they are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain. 7.715266690222806
" "in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of. 2.6835905057681666
" miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection. 4.957832660827564
 "i assure you there is quite as much of  that going on in the country as in town. 5.1322740747008195
 in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived. 3.073412610745333
 i shall see her in january. 1.780471504318568
 but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?" "will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?" "by all means," cried bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of. 30.593768621667785
 that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of  some amiable feeling. 7.977501342478161
" nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. 5.193434666779023
 "i admire all my three sons inlaw highly," said he. 2.6561135832934544
 have you never happened to see her there?" she was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet. 10.001089492250397
 elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room. 22.04425339505114
 the marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. 14.214963195188783
 where shall you change horses? oh! bromley, of course. 5.406908138398115
 and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november, for had it been otherwise, i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. 8.556770706905695
 i pity you, miss eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better. 4.253773246350676
 his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn. 10.676836306577618
 elizabeth was in agonies. 1.3678807991976645
 when he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr bennet to return to longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel. 11.70042059476782
" "no," said her father, "wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. 3.7502803249939727
" "depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them all. 3.7308012718030517
 on the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance. 6.458108502434834
 if he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight. 4.723201870332271
 who should suffer but myself? it has been my own doing, and i ought to feel it. 4.447375128881921
 "i know not, miss elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it. 9.221443873736506
 reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections. 10.483950032671416
 to jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what jane felt for bingley. 17.346959633286115
 she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either. 7.798856054361177
" " that is his notion of christian forgiveness! the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive branch. 9.67091563490318
" it was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from jane. 3.6932378197515012
 amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life. 14.584577004367302
 they could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for Mr darcy. 13.604716692137588
 but i will no longer importune my young cousin. 2.2466129151661995
 the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister. 14.273596447638171
 to miss lydia bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing. 7.597529140959927
 she could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. 6.703090276448464
 the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. 11.024505313553641
 if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law. 14.635978027754838
 i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns. 4.531183438923212
 well, but now for my news: it is about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it? there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king. 11.509571601413747
" "your humility, Mr bingley," said elizabeth, "must disarm reproof. 6.533613969785984
 you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing. 6.665880905328869
 chapter xii. 1.0
 i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!" "i have been used to consider poetry as the  food of love," said darcy. 5.879786839218954
 he now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself, as well as of Mr darcy. 16.735691235531235
 hear me in silence. 1.3644165852978216
" Mrs reynolds's respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master. 7.23233806236492
 when they were all in the drawing room, the questions which elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give. 5.438689016078708
" "well, and what news does it bring? good or bad?" "what is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it. 7.907048852854679
 "can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated. 2.1656426673824054
 she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out. 5.398123987058201
" "there is, i believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome. 6.953535768743074
 on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book. 12.337107966721504
 at present i am not in love with Mr wickham; no, i certainly am not. 5.058005280280712
 and tell my dear lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. 4.64370362868808
" "your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said darcy, "has too much truth. 3.1132018843599845
 her own thoughts were employing her. 1.8850517241974751
 at length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said, "and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting! i might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little  endeavour at civility, i am thus rejected. 13.146871424064646
 what a delightful library you have at pemberley, Mr darcy!" "it ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations. 6.366742309603246
 her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming. 1.6245964890726097
 "do you certainly leave kent on saturday?" said she. 2.0776005944721425
 her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. 2.7831812065382935
 pride & prejudice. 1.075715497396738
 to the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer. 11.311679627562318
 there could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body. 4.389989262124181
 but, on second thoughts, perhaps lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person. 7.780673269483945
 their visits to Mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. 5.0226118600464265
 as soon as jane had read Mr gardiner's hope of lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. 6.987720017259809
 but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done. 4.365524823895134
 it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. 2.3000322661532357
 two days after Mr bennet's return, as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to miss bennet, "i beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so i took the liberty of coming to ask. 20.99896809112341
 it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit. 9.980584617344645
 "aye, there she comes," continued Mrs bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at york, provided she can have her own way. 14.081126072959345
" "i believe, ma'am, i may safely promise you  never to dance with him. 3.821226210100605
 it was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. 19.9230185255866
 she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. 3.4479077402788967
 the sight of miss lucas was odious to her. 1.7862591037445752
" Mrs bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of bingley's behaviour to jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals. 13.759482052218509
 she expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther. 4.746341582105679
 will you tell me how long you have loved him?" "it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began. 4.919735298067696
" "yes," replied wickham;-"his estate there is a noble one. 2.3672856279587764
 why should they try to influence him? they can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it. 5.7078336677691555
 only think of  that my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. 4.657169100448359
 lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation. 10.577101992351198
 chapter viii. 1.0
 we all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him. 5.547027205824446
 it must be an amusing study. 1.2146630582829725
 the tumult of her mind was now painfully great. 2.5013010589800633
 the one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago. 6.3099870387905
 in lydia's imagination, a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. 5.4571640672894155
 jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr darcy could be so unworthy of Mr bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham. 10.731537338108419
 while the family were in this confusion, charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them. 3.9398465372060865
 my sisters may write to  me. 1.2987542518144288
" but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer. 4.578457230108918
  he shall be mercenary, and  she shall be foolish. 2.3961308903387635
 not like the wild young men now adays, who think of nothing but themselves. 4.5817618621956075
 she now lost every expectation of pleasure. 1.8409199541394865
" "poor wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner. 5.3566436730141875
 "fitzwilliam darcy. 1.0
" "mama," cried lydia, "my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in clarke's library. 10.148976960204111
 "i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter!" "la! my dear," said maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not lady catherine. 7.504720511847869
 "oh, jane, take care. 3.9684073806412075
 chapter iii. 1.0
 but in spite of all this fine talking, my dear lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for  another  interest in the affair. 6.943132785475412
 she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley's inattention. 3.2535712185987555
" elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. 7.402649984057727
 but i will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. 3.8047749919795626
" "our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money. 9.575448597046472
 what a fine thing for our girls!" "how so? how can it affect them?" "my dear Mr bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them. 8.16980499441108
" he smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said. 7.2571908111089725
" "i have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as i generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage. 5.562655230246053
 he then handed her in, maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings. 9.45790266390585
" lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence. 4.16412825580638
 jane looked well, and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. 5.578375574161537
 his behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire. 6.791041381445733
 they are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families. 10.46104716132346
 they have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. 3.9981733108764885
 Mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr denny had brought him from london, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the  shire. 13.27972760290731
 but i think Mr darcy improves on acquaintance. 4.4534480420358395
 all elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again. 9.773108312301629
 i know we dine with four and twenty families. 1.9820818663144315
 what is your own opinion?" "that it ought not to be attempted. 2.3981715181826084
 he seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy. 8.61861368466826
 his circumstances, he assured me, and i had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. 3.48536336983771
 Mrs wickham! how well it sounds. 3.9487094342014415
 family pride, and  filial pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this. 7.867286868183536
 had it been your uncle's doing, i must and  would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. 6.7793681587198895
 he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over. 7.836423232163347
 "you are a good girl;" he replied, "and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. 3.301627998180327
 lady catherine observed, after dinner, that miss bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added, "but if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer. 10.387602668379735
 but vanity, not love, has been my folly. 7.301542238947334
 it was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane's attractions. 7.247834420512478
 her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room, to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself. 7.49811563403779
 to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her. 10.265808359820156
 i remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well wisher and friend, william collins. 19.08663324567691
 "what, is he coming home, and without poor lydia!" she cried. 5.767088935870922
 but gracious me! i quite forgot! i ought not to have said a word about it. 3.4021274852598724
" from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr darcy had been over rated, elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs gardiner's long letter, but now, having  that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: "i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, i was too cross to write. 30.14603555632951
 their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. 8.118246435537797
 i will speak to her about it myself directly. 3.365830873278576
" elizabeth looked surprised. 1.0750397202104531
" elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce. 2.82559831840882
 her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully. 8.81891020980589
 it is useless to talk of it. 1.4568871892608088
 their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recal them. 8.126291691418565
 i must be in town next saturday. 1.6354072578866505
" "believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire. 7.725307759276013
 "i am trying to make it out. 1.1525018787597057
 the farewell between herself and Mr wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. 5.822284049698958
 what he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer. 18.057722912629828
 "how abominable! i wonder that the very pride of this Mr darcy has not made him just to you! if from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest, for dishonesty i must call it. 12.73100103687348
 it is not that i do not believe  my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution. 5.294471661053203
" " you observed it, Mr darcy, i am sure," said miss bingley; "and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see  your  sister make such an exhibition. 7.126509584263067
 for my part, Mr bingley,  i always keep servants that can do their own work;  my daughters are brought up differently. 7.805259484167419
 "i am sure," said she, "i cried for two days together when colonel millar's regiment went away. 5.873978487516083
 the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball. 19.70087017413134
 chapter i. 1.0
 his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. 2.2956189455271354
 she answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "when you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance. 6.818662971495944
 she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. 4.3466717267486805
" "he likes to have his own way very well," replied colonel fitzwilliam. 2.004401434541778
 though darcy could never receive  him at pemberley, yet, for elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession. 4.699517064783085
 if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. 8.083236159067491
" elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr wickham's attentions. 5.464249811893873
 but tell me, what did you come down to netherfield for? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?" "my real purpose was to see  you, and to judge, if i could, whether i might ever hope to make you love me. 18.999463856955224
 never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her. 3.140464009029746
 my dear jane, Mr collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking. 15.621287999298657
 the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence. 11.833555156534738
 "i know little of the game, at present," said he, "but i shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of  life" Mrs philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason. 8.589373177733982
 "only think of its being three months," she cried, "since i went away; it seems but a fortnight i declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. 6.103580219428185
 elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth. 3.2156658133673646
 "from the very beginning, from the first moment i may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry. 19.890743513229772
 it originated in Mrs gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's. 8.14105783064243
 very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family. 6.600694218108249
" "if you were aware," said elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, i am sure you would judge differently in the affair. 6.184400880088026
 when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. 18.068327504652693
 those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs forster called her, and they were going to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public. 28.345181467355978
 she grew absolutely ashamed of herself. 1.3995868737923685
 her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. 2.5205169435018377
 but his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited. 17.004723039381933
 "of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. 5.666975108953935
" "i know you do; and it is  that which makes the wonder. 4.857764607066745
 "my dear lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table. 6.2155189023398725
 Mrs collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me? she finds miss pope a treasure. 11.133728968397985
 no man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it. 4.75233070349136
 an express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from colonel forster, to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with wickham! imagine our surprise. 12.373937483573556
" "and have you heard from him often?" "we have heard only once. 3.3348590103397275
 chapter ix. 1.0
 "i am glad i bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. 9.39088585132014
 "we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs gardiner, "but perhaps to the lakes. 6.800113135032942
 but, really, i know not what to say. 6.0484117246219835
 your mother must have been quite a slave to your education. 2.095704327224331
 she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who  did call on him in her return through london, and there relate her journey to longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which  she had refused to give. 19.180967584231627
 as the day of his arrival drew near, "i begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said jane to her sister. 4.406255008570676
 she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself. 9.841323153028567
 you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you. 5.708729980666258
" elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. 10.345634809208946
" "upon my word, sir," cried elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration. 3.7171692040759505
 "if he does not come to me,  then," said she, "i shall give him up for ever. 3.5827055151204963
 he certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. 4.608116124184969
 it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. 5.134653489257357
" "i am not going to run away, papa," said kitty, fretfully; "if  i should ever go to brighton, i would behave better than lydia. 5.661400284440455
" elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. 9.939580784534778
 "i never heard any thing so abominable. 1.5900486589940124
 at least, you should not  remind your mother of inviting him. 3.6347293678457855
 he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, lydia's expences had been very little within that sum. 16.529740649585758
 i am sure you will be very comfortable there. 1.8389437865503295
 if that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon. 5.0205144900531975
 jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved. 10.409323039787429
 this was one point, with regard to lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. 10.41252509117808
 "i am sorry it went off. 1.4057403249424487
 miss bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility, "pray, miss eliza, are not the  shire militia removed from meryton? they must be a great loss to  your family. 10.291795364767877
" "so much the better. 1.7807159255936604
" "this is no very striking resemblance of your own character, i am sure," said he. 2.340182319402024
" "oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. 6.190977635233959
 i was uncomfortable enough. 1.1278119558348818
 "for we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great measure, to his kindness. 2.731740339893706

 jane was beyond competition her favourite child. 1.5649663642359395
 miss bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room. 8.429431140091289
 they entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent. 4.896710553267105
 she had a sister married to a Mr philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade. 9.095258451005101
 elizabeth immediately began playing again. 1.6466931718028002
 "this was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. 10.085599401918863
 her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable; and could she have included jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect. 12.58462990894365
" she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. 4.787134277658792
 i have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for i am two years older. 6.797573968288643
 pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself. 14.926205748064042

 she was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. 4.825998494750695
 his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. 11.44648608088053
 she looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend. 4.287396310616274

 i should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company. 3.9487700537507657
 her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. 5.425735485286714
 "i hope," added Mrs gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. 4.816932289505468
 the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to Mr collins. 7.92330309589808

 "i have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. 3.7320379197505216
 i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr darcy. 5.753505482957277

 they solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister. 10.206522691626695
 "yes if darcy does not put it off again. 2.962777762629168
 in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. 16.813993751769885

 he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband. 8.920633390674196
 "i am sure there is not on  his. 1.8133548463860587
" they were all astonished; and Mr bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said, "but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir? you had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness. 11.149853431937096
 this, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr jones should be sent for early in the morning, if miss bennet were not decidedly better. 8.204935797003131
 one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself. 9.230349877999252

 "oh! mary," said she, "i wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! as we went along, kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and i should have gone so all the way, if kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the george, i do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. 20.659534650282403

" "thank you," said lydia, "for if you did, i should certainly tell you all, and then wickham would be angry. 5.370732706704514

 with many compliments to them, and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter, to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed, "good lord! sir william, how can you tell such a story? do not you know that Mr collins wants to marry lizzy?" nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but sir william's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy. 27.242308252110785
 she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her. 6.518287965004232
 at present we have nothing to guide us. 2.180535162599933
 one ought not to repine; but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! the quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness! but it was not to be. 8.936299085815644
 she could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. 8.848068193367
 she was teazed by Mr collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. 6.669789842424931
" "sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs bennet, alarmed. 6.431188385460144
 "i almost envy you the pleasure, and yet i believe it would be too much for me, or else i could take it in my way to newcastle. 4.6568816907340365
 when the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to elizabeth, "do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. 4.650019925339046

 i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not. 2.2183481832029313
 Mr gardiner was a sensible, gentleman like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. 8.94293147885621
 his air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal. 2.6731001354663864
 Mr collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. 8.390971209281034
 this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given. 13.267703244338266
 her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. 5.481598843782062
" "really, Mr collins," cried elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly. 6.665891880072601
 when darcy returned to the saloon, miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister. 4.291923914914627

 i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. 7.4780393810555195
 her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. 14.341754851755862
 let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood. 3.4391217348372427
 miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose. 5.644884349407904
 nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn, and of her stay in derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts. 14.304838948857702
 as soon as they were gone, elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. 6.625806938985024
 could she exert herself it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, i never in my life saw him so affected. 8.743740688701143
" during their walk, it was resolved that Mr bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening. 5.636859444481419
 but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. 9.455556746234079
 his choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. 3.872801407845439
 chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for  my sake; and for your  own, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. 11.678688659736064
 she is quite a little creature. 1.3910201958757344
 but as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used. 9.00810095357841
 "you are too hasty, sir," she cried. 2.5363058414121338
 Mr bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr darcy than he has received; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man. 18.093895293876677
" "indeed!" cried wickham with a look which did not escape her. 2.0829104708342343
 after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr darcy, drawing near elizabeth, said to  her "do not you feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?" she smiled, but made no answer. 12.715231353314882
 i should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. 3.8571820565735213
" "that is as it happens. 2.4788501339489586
 what a good joke it will be! i can hardly write for laughing. 2.456242812911452
 Mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight. 2.5673707461439195
 i will not spend  my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again. 4.280392082498348
" and she rose as she spoke. 2.636865651401359
 "it was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the  shire. 4.74768813746064
 by this time she is actually with them! if such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! what a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!" "we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said jane: "i hope and trust they will yet be happy. 10.174222383164514
 i suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. 2.9586376247081323
 my brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart. 16.30083355406162
 those who chose to be idle, certainly might. 3.1462919358125734
" elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. 1.5300769001338936
 "he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again. 7.494699895014499
 he heard her attentively, and then said, "lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances. 9.333818666602038
 i want to talk very seriously. 2.0580589523393966
" "miss bingley told me," said jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance. 3.6101051728144857
 the business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news. 5.172582363579861
 elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made. 4.334242175316818
 elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. 6.538610139142263
 Mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. 4.27566876784984
 you have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him. 4.441894980311706
 that he was not a good tempered man, had been her firmest opinion. 4.871103885274041
 i cannot blame myself for having done thus much. 2.2556636419579466
 she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion of her. 3.0440329984931975
 if  you have not been mistaken here,  i must have been in an error. 3.3887150636476866
 they are wanted in the farm, Mr bennet, are not they?" "they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them. 7.983721511442797
 but no such recollection befriended her. 3.090786398130893
 kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. 7.7742746467140575
' are any of your younger sisters out, miss bennet?" "yes, ma'am, all. 4.803928101283025
 oh! lizzy, to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall i bear so much happiness!" she then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with kitty. 9.160453035053214
 my father supported him at school, and afterwards at cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education. 7.495796749555015
 elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. 10.958073610657515
 in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go. 20.199379026710215
 sir william staid only a week at hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. 9.181857068692974
 though her manner varied however, her determination never did. 6.329153806354495
 but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion. 10.478022827533051
 many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. 2.6353523248559365
 this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part. 12.25274735458353
 "very well and this offer of marriage you have refused?" "i have, sir. 4.448231115085254
 he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me. 4.810010442200124
 yours ever, "caroline bingley. 6.3154572071223605
" "that is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily. 2.7406955775959068
 the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this. 2.0506951538424336
 to elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence  had been self imposed. 3.35922092780638
 miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense. 7.759779246184822
 "i must ask whether you were surprised?" said elizabeth. 1.5716998218254374
 pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, i have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. 11.073032552490156
 they were not the only objects of Mr collins's admiration. 3.6130494766433117
 it is impossible. 1.0356673236687246
 you must not disappoint your father. 1.4692326114268637
 i shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance i require. 3.5490223649146553
 i cannot misunderstand you, but i intreat you, dear lizzy, not to pain me by thinking  that  person to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. 8.291076809940805
 her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. 10.690671760732931
 Mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. 4.263801517762406
 why was he to be the judge?" "you are rather disposed to call his interference officious?" "i do not see what right Mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. 12.795075905513146
 tell her that you insist upon her marrying him. 4.702018456878967
" "would Mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?" "upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter, darcy must speak for himself. 12.127938871141161
 Mr darcy was punctual in his return, and as lydia informed you, attended the wedding. 4.794313823870074
 it was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture. 3.119197623724984
 elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. 3.8375130201688887
 but i have always observed, that they who are good natured when children, are good natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest tempered, most generous hearted, boy in the world. 10.438210838954424
 "but it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded. 4.2162222842240125
 my good opinion once lost is lost for ever. 2.268834312510241
 "what would she have said? how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself. 6.385684703010738
" Mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. 6.929708539324053
 the invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine's drawing room. 4.751427158968707
 "you begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her. 2.8191921303083123
 wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. 13.869149617847542
 "i wonder my aunt did not tell us of  that. 2.2578157338740366
" "dear lizzy!" "oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general. 5.052148970529348
 mamma would like to go too of all things! only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!" "yes," thought elizabeth, " that would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once. 9.62266138264058
 the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. 9.141237744841641
 "is it not clear enough? does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? can there be any other opinion on the subject?" "yes, there can; for mine is totally different. 19.481976915207444
 "he is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners! so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!" "he is also handsome," replied elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. 11.75328586459554

" "true," said Mr bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it. 9.150314732326244
 elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants. 2.607108714344434

 having said thus much, i feel no doubt of your secrecy. 2.59003530719166
 i dare say i shall soon see them here. 2.841809173328349
 and do you really love him quite well enough? oh, lizzy! do any thing rather than marry without affection. 4.85691922198832
" "i do assure you, sir, that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. 5.620326221711172
 the visit was returned in due form. 1.7101565838416988
 it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. 7.8408522802686464
 the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. 6.702712879871308
 he was most highly esteemed by Mr darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. 7.028041843138946
 she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him. 5.227407336817503
 Mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. 9.039154528401149
 and when i returned home, the  shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time. 3.834924614008479
" "i certainly shall not. 2.0010592140683117
 bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends. 8.106746466008039
 mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. 8.806972558138893
 but i ought to beg his pardon, for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant. 3.692456672117094
 it was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. 4.379037404784288
 she read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. 3.038604071212545
 i was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that  you, that miss elizabeth bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr darcy. 21.24808775935099
" "perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and Mr robinson; did not i mention it to you? Mr robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and  which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question oh! the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point. 20.113848112568533
 she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. 3.1347121136204623
 she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. 6.60465436114938
 at such a distance as  that, you know, things are strangely misrepresented. 8.137861979734316
 his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret. 5.593925305102136
 the families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. 5.212916885206405
" charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth. 2.215088122623263
 they now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. 3.552943087390535
 but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london. 2.408032983540765
 as yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. 5.198591562790721
 she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power. 14.436227758413713
 every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. 10.74155865218656
 he did not leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a gentleman had called on business. 4.315175482925218
 "lizzy," said he, "what are you doing? are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? have not you always hated him?" how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr darcy. 15.520428651493736
 "i did not think caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london. 7.396920978979117
 the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met. 4.089158492486782
" from herself to jane from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr darcy's explanation  there, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. 12.15362368818184
  you wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if i speak ill of any body. 4.492866821067281
 the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers. 12.580551611579073
 wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. 10.342937578659642
 chapter xviii. 1.0
 it was the last of the regiment's stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. 7.281546784293826
 with such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr wickham and the officers, Mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. 25.685868836771434
 i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's connections. 1.8987177287518495
 "i wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer. 4.394151206348869
" "i will not trust myself on the subject," replied wickham, " i can hardly be just to him. 3.1339558832599526
 when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him. 10.523277289495335
 it needed all jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity. 4.955449973745587
 she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion. 15.286626556557982
 no, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very good luck, i may meet with another Mr collins in time. 11.573091317566625
 she examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs collins's joints of meat were too large for her family. 19.541545503449257
" "my dear," replied her husband, "i have two small favours to request. 2.6132472600667747
 his being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. 10.065415234230434
" "had you then persuaded yourself that i should?" "indeed i had. 5.420274661895907

 whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure. 6.699048661824376
 but i confess they would have no charms for  me. 1.5691589192006443
" she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted. 14.810877833357072
 she was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so. 2.8692302412935873
 "did it," said he, "did it  soon make you think better of me? did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?" she explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed. 12.698755901399664
 in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. 5.03728695791767
" "there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. 3.225219098081437
 "from what we have seen of him," continued Mrs gardiner, "i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor wickham. 8.380787039347707
 well, he certainly is very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him. 3.6584662195156032
 miss darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. 9.653282637574137
 but georgiana would not join her. 1.1458565046604836
 they are all for what they can get. 2.180832455002445
" "upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation. 4.903947627734346
 i had not an idea of it. 1.4660711699019164

 in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society. 3.4676393728191655
" "my fingers," said elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women's do. 3.998782007848364
 james's?" "never, sir. 2.037097707489466
 and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. 5.576438273541576
 one morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to elizabeth, "lizzy, i never gave  you an account of my wedding, i believe. 6.316882446750639
 to know that her daughter would be married was enough. 2.372227775299471
 whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. 8.269287427964034
 elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her. 5.768061856309994
" "an excellent consolation in its way," said elizabeth, "but it will not do for  us. 2.225031211780362
 both sisters were uncomfortable enough. 1.3161587341287013
 after lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses. 14.382388693138898
 but they did pass away, and Mr and Mrs gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at longbourn. 6.935568511899652
 my poor father! how he must have felt it!" "i never saw any one so shocked. 2.634954611159143
 make haste, make haste. 2.756195108641788
 after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?" "and we mean to treat you all," added lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there. 14.798817490277257
 elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her. 4.202801451903157
 that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain, but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. 5.858536939821869
 if he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him. 14.691333495449971
 miss bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening  she was his settled choice. 9.066081146340085
" "yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. 4.016333344925878
" words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences. 6.278729172601376
 she coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth. 4.248819396091209
 good girl! it would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of miss bingley's pretended regard. 4.531785481118626

 it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too, and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. 4.199665966960525
 the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion. 4.061388984012801
" away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. 8.248800963130762
 and what do you think she said besides? 'ah! Mrs bennet, we shall have her at netherfield at last. 8.401562896539257
 observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with, "i hope Mr bingley will like it lizzy. 7.658032248454315
 he answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. 7.291066336013034
 i know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. 8.736055178592375
 he comes down on thursday at the latest, very likely on wednesday. 3.2113121192471135
 though lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr and Mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected. 8.565909139099281
 but that is not the case  here. 2.9240622264806566
 miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much. 2.8094105432990504
 let  our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers. 6.7347723180925305
 but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house. 5.954213977822975
" "what should not you mind?" "i should not mind any thing at all. 3.1367828153825865
 sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. 2.968804776162455
 "and they are really to be married!" cried elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. 3.6107575973839805
 i would go and see her, if i could have the carriage. 3.6600367060618786
" she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held. 5.557207333580611
 Mr darcy said very little, and Mr hurst nothing at all. 5.638164737830913
 as they went down stairs together, charlotte said, "i shall depend on hearing from you very often, eliza. 3.500029778284995
 jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare. 3.2460678304314716
" "i am no longer surprised at your knowing  only six accomplished women. 2.817956960113208
 sir william did not say much. 1.6698472063278245
 of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with. 13.487229678309507
 "my father and maria are to come to me in march," added charlotte, "and i hope you will consent to be of the party. 4.7369225193344064
 without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment. 9.881534619712788
 her ladyship was highly incensed. 1.3589344051222356
 and on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper, "the men shan't come and part us, i am determined. 9.019467481624194
 he began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. 8.745514314564177
 it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. 9.963293725588619
 he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him, to lay his private actions open to the world. 8.997247901535305
 Mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off. 2.2143968520804878
 it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. 3.031786666517843
" "is that his design in settling here?" "design! nonsense, how can you talk so! but it is very likely that he  may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes. 6.652875022159903
 bingley was ready, georgiana was eager, and darcy determined, to be pleased. 5.430216336067282
 i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish. 5.262803776042536
" "lizzy, when you first read that letter, i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now. 4.887016565650773
 as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. 3.9909360673481453
 "i am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said lady catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal. 5.625203127582311
 egerton, military library, whitehall. 3.669216112790655
 he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. 4.608247972330475
 a report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago. 3.236732150022661
 after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday. 7.571836482234292
 they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of  that they would have been glad to be certain. 3.5852679927639297
 unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only  child) i was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to  wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. 20.256791172701682
 neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane. 3.26061501196257
 "oh! yes i understand you perfectly. 2.596076794374339
 in this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. 15.594350883409419
 that she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs hurst and miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. 8.579804341484644
" "we will be down as soon as we can," said jane; "but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago. 5.763545622714263
 i ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr collins's character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state. 9.542527522771271
 "when is your next ball to be, lizzy?" "to morrow fortnight. 3.3521859670200254
" "yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside. 2.814617147813357
 everything wore a happier aspect. 3.1333665839376748
 by tea time however the dose had been enough, and Mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. 9.093252959636065
 to kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. 2.896201860899913
 elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. 3.161750645678687
 james's had made him courteous. 3.7183705432388847
 "do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. 3.9570141154885268
 it was an encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should very strenuously have opposed it. 6.119230227587207
 he knows of my being in town, i am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy. 8.083502923797655
 such was miss lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon. 7.197962440330814
 elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot. 16.87482756567912
 chapter vii. 1.0
 elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london. 25.57983412551241
 there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. 3.28297538901243
 "it would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference, but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. 4.387700299910848
 scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. 9.428701780587748
 he  was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey. 6.740004615334106
" "my uncle is to send a servant for us. 2.065218513025138
" "no, that i am sure i shall not; and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. 5.570460694364783
" the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane, who were dancing together. 6.304984792246945

 "why, my dear, you must know, Mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr morris immediately; that he is to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week. 19.474536030835978

 his brother inlaw, Mr hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. 16.79477578149945
 the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience. 4.234645652726724
 as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. 18.013490720544347

 after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing miss bingley's voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family. 7.574863181734546
 in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before. 3.130586806252853
 eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley, and then hurried away to dress. 7.31076140182537

 but now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground. 12.882784126437421
 at first there seemed danger of lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular. 13.016507083746308

 lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr bennet was likely to live; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st. 14.751364178818752

 she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence; Mr darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. 12.086694505060267
 she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton scheme, of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents. 5.690701523083619

 bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on. 4.159851897134238
 i feel as if i had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve. 5.495173983765363
 not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body. 3.3713534600773944
 it is highly improper. 1.3821997295255197
 when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. 5.769206658914386
 there was one part especially, the opening of it, which i should dread your having the power of reading again. 6.6000443122192936
 in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. 5.615325570880355
 it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before. 6.9963069778437585
 she was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung. 4.0250370240922235
 it was owing to him, to his reserve, and want of proper consideration, that wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. 6.120286447042697
 her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. 12.581249514344849
 such i was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such i might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth! what do i not owe you! you taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. 25.066986488163327
 regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure, but i wrote to Mr wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs younge was of course removed from her charge. 11.625201634265338
 there was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible, that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. 7.4282349565029815
 the reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as i have given above. 3.9564656850187583
 Mr what's his name. 3.608337481763534
 not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said, "jane, i congratulate you. 9.258873978612598
 she dared not relate the other half of Mr darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. 4.427758576996522
 she could think of nothing else, and yet whether bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded. 13.592396357257734
" elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. 1.2840182513630423
 if she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. 3.5376661688240776
 "you doubt me," cried jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason. 2.8055663810012192
 they both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered. 5.803524827242034
 i am quite well. 1.2069769902623482
 it is Mr wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. 9.390597923594823
 there can be no love in all this. 2.6413135028357244
 this information, however, startled Mrs bennet; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so. 8.178245744180893
 but i know the foundation is unjust. 1.7194207724002812
 to be sure london was rather thin, but however the little theatre was open. 5.034793139450242
 when breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane. 5.898385638854007
 chapter viii. 1.0
 i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. 6.326996331686166
 but if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself. 3.1253673411720726
 the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. 1.5885919837887885
 there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, i begin to think it perfectly reasonable. 7.3158874828105365
" "but upon my honour i do  not. 1.3091235791352223
 she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but jane; and even feared that with the others it was a  dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away. 13.205780976764949
 sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. 4.620878958335355
 it cannot be done too much; and when i next write to her, i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. 5.88637439070116
 i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. 2.421162398983907
 the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions. 4.981453745791073
 with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my dearest jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?" "what think you of  this sentence, my dear lizzy?" said jane as she finished it. 15.092938132645441
 i expected you to stay two months. 1.9259693234624422
 she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner, whenever they did. 7.460001323789151
 they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family. 16.95641381057735
 darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently consented. 5.274674632431336
" "yes, madam," said Mrs bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine. 4.336673975291466
 i guessed as much. 2.7989701544094516
 such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret. 5.419232526745306
 miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before. 2.8855355994186733

 this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself. 2.3000158862661246
 you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, i am sure you did. 4.438485483214526
 she was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him. 6.341074610988629
 lydia's being settled in the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites. 15.7130093615211
 you have delighted us long enough. 2.6816452787998206
 i wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. 4.508081607575503
 but at length, by elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city. 21.025595710756722

 your mother insists upon your accepting it. 2.8756921397191704
 oh! why is not every body as happy?" elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. 8.54701263414279
 Mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking, mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together. 4.795798155153647
 charlotte did not stay much longer, and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. 3.275735736776399
 charlotte herself was tolerably composed. 2.592065611234727
 her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology," "hunsford," and "lady catherine de bourgh. 10.084651883452802
 he left netherfield for london, on the day following, as you, i am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning. 6.479873179102223
 she then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said, "by the bye, charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield? i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure. 18.07300122337671
 "if it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said she, "i should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful. 4.581582578851409

" "we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said elizabeth. 4.053449754596037
 but with such a father and mother, and such low connections, i am afraid there is no chance of it. 3.235282669236644
 she is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and i understand highly accomplished. 3.282047996327771
 she had never perceived, while the regiment was in hertfordshire, that lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body. 6.3285106044716315
 elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. 5.6809961556979065
 but of course she did not mention my name to you. 3.1445473105150716
 Mr darcy is engaged to  my  daughter. 1.6483458095386463
 "and may i ask?" said elizabeth, "but the terms, i suppose, must be complied with. 4.282775504989904
 you are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage. 3.5010623441120026
 "but, my dear elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is miss king? i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary. 4.750231334311363
 he was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied, "just as you please. 6.2335500469833836
 i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more. 5.173638948865711
 they may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride. 8.205525252743314
 its business office is located at Number north Number west, salt lake city, ut Number, (Number) Number Number. 32.14757252790007
 after discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight; for lady catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men. 20.936179273892154
 she has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever. 5.750226014296237
 no officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village. 4.266930772694977
 she was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what. 4.357575223764386
 it was all over before i arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as  your' s seems to have been. 5.981884548158062
 "if, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "i shall know how to understand it. 6.127388111781013
 she must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains. 6.728480969099844
 from what i can collect, he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. 7.289254136936044
 risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which i should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that  we shall take no offence. 7.21287081542541
 had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. 12.53680298006167
 the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn, and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. 4.117109235654553
 jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. 6.198870113225066
 are not you curious to hear how it was managed?" "no really," replied elizabeth; "i think there cannot be too little said on the subject. 6.50767324422643
 she shall hear my opinion. 1.1535773583943103

" "this is the consequence you see, madam, of marrying a daughter," said elizabeth. 5.529348318327573
 sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. 8.41790887878027
 his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others, as in his reproaches to myself. 12.222250086189431
" this roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once. 3.943254207862408
 but every body is to judge for themselves, and the lucases are very good sort of girls, i assure you. 3.512018457046516
 well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. 4.719575206702427
 they had not been long together, before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. 9.994201492966834
 her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. 4.730833322945413
" wickham only shook his head. 2.78296468538522
  my father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr philips, appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property. 14.996612063148284
" "it ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason. 3.4127002986486232

 that  she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. 2.5856033908921234
 from that moment i observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him. 5.008010061850142
" "if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is, i shall know what to think. 3.7060355289260154
" "and  that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london! my dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr darcy may perhaps have  heard of such a place as gracechurch street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr bingley never stirs without him. 20.361345058860902
 Mr hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep. 7.3420988653443375
 "what could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning" and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him? "not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it. 17.545794537570725
" after walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. 14.0434630208666
 the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter. 2.376903094584621
 we have not met since the Numberth of november, when we were all dancing together at netherfield. 3.3845927198310766
  i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me. 3.6504683549412533
 "i have no reason, i assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception. 2.440519725588555
 one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad. 10.426376898672352
 there was certainly at this moment, in elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance. 6.17190418485543
" "and what is fifty miles of good road? little more than half a day's journey. 3.1238678898105583
 i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. 8.227762848074546
 the moment of her release from him was ecstacy. 4.002979076202092
 it was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever. 8.80446016544964
 the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again. 4.466805753426995
  we were always good friends; and now we are better. 2.797115624470041
 she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. 5.564326386656507
" to complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia. 6.265317059218704
" "i assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice. 3.247344913506212
" * * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and Mrs bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived. 11.856620986594919
" "if your master would marry, you might see more of him. 3.230905120711893
 you dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind. 17.906631834709515
 he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good natured, gossiping lucases. 6.748272588531824
 "it may perhaps be pleasant," replied charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. 5.66653103042868
 she had very little notice from any but him. 3.5507947678121434

 her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. 3.2559259287064934
 "your examination of Mr darcy is over, i presume," said miss bingley;-"and pray what is the result?" "i am perfectly convinced by it that Mr darcy has no defect. 10.888698541249195
 Mr collins then returned to elizabeth. 1.609346445336136
 how long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am i to wish you joy?" "that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask. 7.69077240156181

 four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him. 2.050637045697792

" "will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again? at present i have not room to do them justice. 5.351485397952949
 Mrs bennet said only, "nonsense, nonsense!" "what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he. 7.873851562663798
 the day of his and lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth. 12.97317888874519
 when the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist. 4.114269286791099

 the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. 2.275777638425811

 jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. 3.370489563472155
 the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête àtête with Mrs bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very jane he had fixed on. 16.806988119677357
 of neither darcy nor wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd. 8.153401611487338
 when this was done, she had a less active part to play. 2.822071678031359
" "do let us have a little music," cried miss bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. 2.649638939733729
 smiles decked the face of Mrs bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy. 11.395030794665617
" mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how. 2.4345708561848842

 her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. 5.757875059906504
 we acted with the best intentions. 1.6407788621230417

 my mind was more agreeably engaged. 1.440102656826836
" Mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. 6.607843241107907

 they attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas. 10.096712171258469
 nothing could be more delightful! to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr bingley's heart were entertained. 7.097239474308137
  she blushed, and jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour. 6.407403952049489

 indeed he has no improper pride. 1.957857036572711
" elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop, or lady catherine de bourgh, by venturing to dance. 16.531197202739182
" "good god! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "i will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr and Mrs gardiner. 10.291245087226056
 "believe me, my dear miss elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. 8.586559217921595
" but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered, "no, no; stay where you are. 8.521655295975648
" "oh!" cried miss bingley, "charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. 4.1702251825222705

 an union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family. 4.892903941081668
 it was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. 6.58712913964141

 Mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets. 2.697486429158393
 he carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by sir william, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear. 12.789021479568602
 on the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? the general prejudice against Mr darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. 14.90657756161631
" "i beg your pardon," replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer. 1.7143337977766284
" "do you really think so?" cried elizabeth, brightening up for a moment. 2.674627923816337
 all loveliness and goodness as she is! her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. 9.008625401617465
" this was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for. 11.11413253604911
 i dare say Mr bingley will be very glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy. 10.382968142505025
" Mr bennet's expectations were fully answered. 3.0395570827375966
" "but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out. 4.281831774981868
" a short pause followed this speech, and Mrs hurst began again. 2.812278225154091
 mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. 6.543808489676226
 if you should have no objection to receive me into your house, i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, monday, november Numberth, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se'night following, which i can do without any inconvenience, as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. 18.183005222625205
 her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too  little, she might have fancied too  much. 10.155757246390152
" "has your governess left you?" "we never had any governess. 2.6249844981917536
 when the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time. 6.677449656274813
 "well, lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the collinses live very comfortable, do they? well, well, i only hope it will last. 12.53566444626997
" "very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say. 2.0492365459043254
 i now give it to  you, if you are resolved on having him. 4.496336298234018
 i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his regimentals. 17.609705269735098
" "very true, indeed; and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? do clear  them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody. 8.807266692501363
 the family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them. 2.1033386769306954
 i had not been long in hertfordshire, before i saw, in common with others, that bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other young woman in the country. 5.615973921537795
 at that ball, while i had the honour of dancing with you, i was first made acquainted, by sir william lucas's accidental information, that bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. 8.26853841402656
" "certainly not; at first. 2.308454057711903
 but in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded. 13.29852194554463
" elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry. 5.137296315151526
 they were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs bennet's civilities. 8.421809755549964
 she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. 8.752389172611469
 i hope there was. 1.1552680621634424
" Mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer. 2.405908043625964
" "if i were as rich as Mr darcy," cried a young lucas who came with his sisters, "i should not care how proud i was. 5.79697110063626
" every body was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. 5.801944695593875
 the officer was the very Mr denny, concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. 6.8750822322051395
" and taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to sir william, "indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing. 11.367038060447646
" elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to colonel fitzwilliam, "your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word i say. 5.9866513368039875
 day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood. 10.518996967525371
" "these are heavy misfortunes," replied elizabeth. 1.6707998415567467
" "dear madam," cried Mrs hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr gardiner? he has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter. 14.503427315002961
" jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall; elizabeth was glad of it; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante. 10.970608366971911

 i must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. 7.3471013334329305

 bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept. 13.982570909493448
 elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself. 22.109426553077345
 she was very equal therefore to address Mr bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. 8.634170510646285
 her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family. 9.180368678164278
 but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. 4.309816068686491
 a house in town! every thing that is charming! three daughters married! ten thousand a year! oh, lord! what will become of me. 7.030716911887282

 astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. 4.849197699849875
 i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. 5.469134076505658
 but we are all liable to error. 2.1059327766356617
" occupied in observing Mr bingley's attentions to her sister, elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. 6.28604659631975
 i roused, and interested you, because i was so unlike  them. 4.653127089501148
 the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. 6.190710268307093

 but Mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. 11.696478245920847
 but, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if i still assert, that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. 10.821269805617435
" "you have a very small park here," returned lady catherine after a short silence. 2.457584083275203
 i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat. 1.5002341365361953
 to elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. 16.031308204984782
" "removed!" cried bingley. 1.4847562134526493
" "that would be a good scheme," said elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home. 3.149529275278575
" the tumult of elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. 3.1458993249884153
 at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her. 10.252741297769825
 the feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten. 7.061255128324173
 the coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to longbourn. 6.351144704123808
" "yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. 4.8275982749573245
 before any answer could arrive from Mr collins, or any congratulations to elizabeth, from his wife, the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge. 9.86369262586458
 they went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her. 4.322034073100894
 darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. 10.652153622269118
 i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. 4.391792712156859

 her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to darcy, much more than to any other person in the room. 10.935361518441866
 the more i see of the world, the more am i dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense. 13.48805291074095

 "this is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! another day i will do the same; i will sit in my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as i can, or, perhaps, i may defer it, till kitty runs away. 18.88187576631161
 lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth. 7.253141005365787

 how far your nephew might approve of your interference in  his affairs, i cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. 5.153810511439616
" persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected. 12.323969129221028
 but Mr gardiner could not be seen, and Mr darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. 9.791350309591556
 i only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, i imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe. 16.739940457188062
 on reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. 4.967683634059456
 Mrs bennet could hardly contain herself. 1.9643217960157415
 "oh! yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished! she plays and sings all day long. 8.313546806329336
" "i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. 2.674232245795532
 Mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death, Mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to  him, as of affection to myself. 12.25820097468781
" "and quite alone? have all her friends left her?" "Mrs annesley is with her. 8.122456626380846

 you must learn some of my philosophy. 1.5352717561013818
 on finding Mrs bennet, elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words, "may i hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth, when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?" before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs bennet instantly answered, "oh dear! yescertainly. 22.292865726710225
 their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr and Mrs gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner at pemberley, before they left the country. 10.577055300515749
 the advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. 4.414154729663867
 to no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to elizabeth; and from all bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. 12.757363431510894
 "eliza bennet," said miss bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, i dare say, it succeeds. 8.002465993917246
" "i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. 6.35178277908159
 "how good it was in you, my dear Mr bennet! but i knew i should persuade you at last. 8.10286605320396
 on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects. 2.688837043972113
" "i like her appearance," said elizabeth, struck with other ideas. 2.5684897135530957
 Mr collins on his return highly gratified Mrs bennet by admiring Mrs philips's manners and politeness. 8.649626301225402

 she wrote even to jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard. 4.57294118355855
" "oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. 3.658450255075804

" "you persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him. 3.4886406585449468
 Mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. 10.690863662365059
 "oh! yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well, and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again. 4.922077390342251
 these bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had i with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by every thing. 13.455218186791956
" "it is difficult indeed it is distressing. 2.299528361131128
 if his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,  he was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. 7.577542466046504
" "what did you say of me, that i did not deserve? for, though your accusations were ill founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof. 9.26510885463367
 after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with "it is  your turn to say something now, Mr darcy. 5.812259026659483
 if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity. 8.954974691840267
" "indeed, Mr collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. 3.5329375744741958
 "you may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time. 7.677306808386254
 his appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. 6.614554589387599

 when first Mr bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. 8.413040182300206
 he addressed himself directly to miss bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley's salutation. 10.18002122047289
 she felt that jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility. 7.248446460359181
 it is unaccountable! in every view it is unaccountable!" "my dear lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. 4.813517285117586
" elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying. 3.3374729342858314
 the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. 3.9638310901223757
 lady catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr darcy. 7.871337872114697
 i hardly know how Mr collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long. 4.91312517081602
 the idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to  her. 10.96664281104712

 oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!" wickham, lydia, were all forgotten. 5.807799712823073
 she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than  she could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with  one, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side. 14.26799909266562
 he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. 5.329481276833157
 the rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of rosings. 17.155759080901838
" "as i did the other day," said elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from  that. 4.643482864969745

 her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity. 14.501203867252523
 only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. 4.690074998370689
 elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since  her coming away. 5.736826984988179
 his sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london. 9.95709652158964

 "you have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! unfeeling, selfish girl! do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?" "lady catherine, i have nothing farther to say. 9.678763336346888
 she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be. 7.411644935826305

" "yes but as it happens, they are all of them very clever. 4.148701897775408

 ever since i have known it, i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it. 4.272011112089607

 his most particular friend, you see by jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. 3.776527177350703
 wickham will never marry a woman without some money. 1.3683431129848898
 he cannot afford it. 1.1634973193255622
 and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, i am not able to judge; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. 18.903734464576367
 but as to your other objection, i am afraid it will hardly hold good. 2.860160520479872
 lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that  he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter. 10.526335922924183
" "but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?" "it does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. 8.16414884893444
 but, really, i know not what to say. 6.0484117246219835
 perhaps i am not doing her justice. 1.6161556699631985
 but she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. 7.063317523355873
 she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. 6.010976233947791
 since the  shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. 6.2545345788134865
 she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater what shall i call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. 6.433005452698489
 and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman. 4.289667188898836
" "but you see that jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt. 3.312324720979807
" "of whom does jane ever think ill? and who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? but jane knows, as well as i do, what wickham really is. 12.82656389279284
 we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word. 2.941275748903896
 that he has neither integrity nor honour. 1.2428399352840651
 that he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating. 3.6672612780795717
" "and do you really know all this?" cried Mrs gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive. 5.333835049977255
 "i do, indeed," replied elizabeth, colouring. 2.677814374483648
 "i told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr darcy; and you, yourself, when last at longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. 8.670219512328137
 and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless. 5.155534933160515
 from what he said of miss darcy, i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. 3.3065549611583553
 yet he knew to the contrary himself. 1.8188484177334363
 he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her. 3.4832710745953848
" "but does lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand?" "oh, yes! that, that is the worst of all. 8.464266315491901
 till i was in kent, and saw so much both of Mr darcy and his relation, colonel fitzwilliam, i was ignorant of the truth myself. 5.853948624290276
 and when i returned home, the  shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time. 3.834924614008479
 as that was the case, neither jane, to whom i related the whole, nor i, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? and even when it was settled that lydia should go with Mrs forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. 16.72777475757563
 that  she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. 2.5856033908921234
 that such a consequence as  this should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts. 3.526062782908867
" "when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had no reason, i suppose, to believe them fond of each other. 4.1819172752644125
" "not the slightest. 1.3535465102646413
 i can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away. 7.461698586992657
 when first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. 4.56674933027432
 every girl in, or near meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished  her by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites. 11.12041277041105
" * * * * * it may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. 12.212012502182647
 from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent. 1.5309364548636513
 fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness. 4.061119827658223
 they travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached longbourn by dinner time the next day. 9.559356722177949
 it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations. 4.195715965341915
 the little gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome. 17.323575235517737
 elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her. 5.768061856309994
 elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives. 7.649781240961463
 "not yet," replied jane. 2.051084639565478
 "but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope every thing will be well. 4.250272362887868
" "is my father in town?" "yes, he went on tuesday as i wrote you word. 3.1371770566530177
" "and have you heard from him often?" "we have heard only once. 3.3348590103397275
 he wrote me a few lines on wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which i particularly begged him to do. 6.623042632672254
 he merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention. 2.47257533471335
" "and my mother how is she? how are you all?" "my mother is tolerably well, i trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken. 6.231480768296467
 she is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. 2.525926263991541

" "but you how are you?" cried elizabeth. 3.26176755753865
 "you look pale. 1.041785530150965
 how much you must have gone through!" her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr and Mrs gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party. 9.08657037167831
 jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears. 5.557537666463249
 when they were all in the drawing room, the questions which elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give. 5.438689016078708
 the sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage. 10.862296582671272
 Mrs bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing. 19.155057218110368
 "if i had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to brighton, with all my family,  this would not have happened; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her. 5.0483220811825
 why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight? i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after. 7.230169541680608
 i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but i was over ruled, as i always am. 5.054189754646707
 poor dear child! and now here's Mr bennet gone away, and i know he will fight wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? the collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what we shall do. 10.943507969305838
" they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in london the very next day, and would assist Mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia. 14.883112135903845
 "do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. 3.9570141154885268
 it is not quite a week since they left brighton. 1.593317048727624
 in a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. 6.038364118087135
 as soon as i get to town, i shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to gracechurch street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done. 6.288538238005653
" "oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs bennet, "that is exactly what i could most wish for. 2.7723591387727655
 and now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already,  make them marry. 7.421956522422706
 and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married. 7.41283754806544
 and, above all things, keep Mr bennet from fighting. 11.753210612454867
 tell him what a dreadful state i am in, that i am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that i can get no rest by night nor by day. 14.657842654269333
 and tell my dear lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. 4.64370362868808
 oh, brother, how kind you are! i know you will contrive it all. 5.761246394210536
" but Mr gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters. 13.657690880643887
 though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that  one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject. 15.304534191402132
 in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before. 3.130586806252853
 one came from her books, and the other from her toilette. 2.8900511866151963
 the faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of kitty. 12.872983861874355
 as for mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table, "this is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of. 7.28266102480492
 but we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation. 7.6205915461327
" then, perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex. 19.005034977207753
" elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. 2.0819404296742574
 mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them. 4.307214826333159
 in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which jane was equally eager to satisfy. 5.4200747855347124
 after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, "but tell me all and every thing about it, which i have not already heard. 11.512349389712123
 give me farther particulars. 1.4007725670048508
 what did colonel forster say? had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place? they must have seen them together for ever. 3.741988184526284
" "colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. 4.840624255313038
 i am so grieved for him. 1.240524549960361
 his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. 2.2956189455271354
 he  was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey. 6.740004615334106
" "and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry? did he know of their intending to go off? had colonel forster seen denny himself?" "yes; but when questioned by  him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. 7.589552821737375
 he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from  that, i am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before. 4.847710414341887
" "and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?" "how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. 8.905064818720861
 my father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. 5.6724241174626755
 kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step. 4.738515819295194
 she had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks. 3.461652826501363
" "but not before they went to brighton?" "no, i believe not. 2.754092977150795
" "and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself? does he know his real character?" "i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did. 4.52480374352496
 he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. 1.3963746137034414
 and since this sad affair has taken place, it is said, that he left meryton greatly in debt; but i hope this may be false. 3.575772543359776
" "oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!" "perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister. 7.319942315211921
 "but to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. 4.334649472501615
 we acted with the best intentions. 1.6407788621230417
" "could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his wife?" "he brought it with him for us to see. 2.708250531361781
" jane then took it from her pocket book, and gave it to elizabeth. 3.146845572949545
 these were the contents: "my dear harriet, "you will laugh when you know where i am gone, and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning, as soon as i am missed. 5.161380290140242
 i am going to gretna green, and if you cannot guess with who, i shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world i love, and he is an angel. 8.30667438453205
 i should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off. 4.341959080153633
 you need not send them word at longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when i write to them, and sign my name lydia wickham. 7.836528923421692
 what a good joke it will be! i can hardly write for laughing. 2.456242812911452
 pray make my excuses to pratt, for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to night. 5.6816896166672946
 tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. 6.149939564461833
 i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are packed up. 4.617886945090815
 good bye. 1.0
 give my love to colonel forster, i hope you will drink to our good journey. 2.7847030129780066
 "your affectionate friend, "lydia bennet. 3.614719214693194
" "oh! thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!" cried elizabeth when she had finished it. 4.235981877829669
 "what a letter is this, to be written at such a moment. 3.9979006938225456
 but at least it shews, that  she was serious in the object of her journey. 2.497174977535256
 whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a  scheme of infamy. 5.118602586858072
 my poor father! how he must have felt it!" "i never saw any one so shocked. 2.634954611159143
 he could not speak a word for full ten minutes. 1.959297552727118
 my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!" "oh! jane," cried elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?" "i do not know. 6.243384174245774
 i hope there was. 1.1552680621634424
 but to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult. 2.908209239703216
 my mother was in hysterics, and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done! but the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties. 9.086388903293713
" "your attendance upon her, has been too much for you. 1.6507404193883406
 you do not look well. 1.5663241986783516
 oh! that i had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone. 5.476122529764297
" "mary and kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, i am sure, but i did not think it right for either of them. 4.518596387525121
 kitty is slight and delicate, and mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. 3.6798341670747408
 my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me. 3.638260179646047
 she was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady lucas has been very kind; she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us. 12.162791855097872
" "she had better have stayed at home," cried elizabeth; "perhaps she  meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours. 5.647074402699177
 assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable. 2.310667691110132
 let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied. 3.5230978189696445
" she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter. 3.559659225331217
 "he meant, i believe," replied jane, "to go to epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could be made out from them. 6.463610500300022
 his principal object must be, to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham. 2.4416933271849732
 it had come with a fare from london; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at clapham. 7.950831289849112
 if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. 8.083236159067491
 i do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this. 4.811951956481819
" chapter vi. 1.0445527549099645
 the whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him. 5.036633964235814
 his family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion. 7.264586232548416
 they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of  that they would have been glad to be certain. 3.5852679927639297
 Mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off. 2.2143968520804878
 when he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr bennet to return to longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel. 11.70042059476782
 Mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. 4.27566876784984
 she shared in their attendance on Mrs bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom. 5.42445961149262
 their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them. 8.95828172495903
 all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light. 4.796797299029627
