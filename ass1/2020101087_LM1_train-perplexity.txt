3.560640070573213
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley. 2.8847814975299673
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , "i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal. 3.084691230222048
"if we make haste , " said lydia , as they walked along , "perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes. 3.379377745810789
if it be not so , let Mr darcy contradict it. 3.3035704584441956
- "i assure you , i feel it exceedingly , " said lady catherine ; "i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do. 3.7137881118228826
every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time. 4.087173624139554
"believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections. 3.5747357358151444
the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first. 3.57656983787654
her colour changed , and she said no more. 4.235891230314323
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , Mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. 4.596995260708226
" she wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen miss bingley. 3.6443325011659864
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " "your ladyship has declared it to be impossible. 3.183346887467732
you shall hear what she says. 3.315152465077339
the gentlemen did approach ; and when Mr wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. 3.7038203725078915
on this subject , what can you have to say ? in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? " "you take an eager interest in that gentleman 's concerns , " said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour. 3.2886872555710784
i desire you will stay where you are. 3.2952051396767525
* * * * * in the evening , soon after Mr bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. 3.652862741370026
" "no , no , nonsense , lizzy. 3.0103207438436024
but , really , i know not what to say. 3.451677574584295
chapter xix. 2.857179731996027
his surprise was great. 3.7357806272009424
Mr darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours. 4.017566381764077
laws alone swamp our small staff. 3.9847178825966267
for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body. 4.070437644886438
"you forget that i have made no answer. 3.8601744138851317
had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt , to my own family ! had his character been known , this could not have happened. 3.5605952174568842
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs long. 3.6133577468608404
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret. 3.660230848068714
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him. 3.6482249284803134
not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them. 4.339029579581187
bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. 3.802145601626683
" "i will not trust myself on the subject , " replied wickham , " i can hardly be just to him. 3.7740623273702636
he came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed. 4.5414631555891685
"and this , " said she , "is the end of all his friend 's anxious circumspection ! of all his sister 's falsehood and contrivance ! the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! " in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose. 3.497695842222767
console lady catherine as well as you can. 4.90914807584835
put them next to your great uncle the judge. 3.655532200385652
"could i expect it to be otherwise ! " said she. 4.037555692074875
" she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter. 3.5205745737878105
" and gravely glancing at Mr darcy , "there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' and i shall keep mine to swell my song. 3.54665809182249

in the hall they parted. 3.7511736110591607
if i had ever learnt , i should have been a great proficient. 4.432779089746531
his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. 3.0732398832256096
she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some accident been lost. 3.830480276554356
" "what think you of books ? " said he , smiling. 2.9713217730839996
since her father 's death , her home has been london , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education. 3.856399647322436
" "oh ! shocking ! " cried miss bingley. 3.229577335298441
she studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. 3.1716614642516405
astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her. 4.489791326589961
" chapter xviii. 2.633869105314287
" this was not very consoling to Mrs bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , "i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. 4.029042359345241
oh ! that abominable Mr darcy ! my father 's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and i should be miserable to forfeit it. 3.762124787678161
it was gratitude. 3.5671989622134452
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr darcy 's civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister. 3.6075101108380383
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood. 3.433316025477377
you will have a charming mother inlaw , indeed , and of course she will be always at pemberley with you. 3.9583202427554163
" "i wish it may. 3.343252667190409
be assured , my dear sir , that Mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. 3.829747264543793
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him. 3.8238108840785956
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great. 4.058045260661136
miss darcy , the daughter of Mr darcy , of pemberley , and lady anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. 3.9188558716828705
but let me advise you to think better of it. 3.4378230431894616
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter. 4.061466950295295
chapter xv. 2.2111971152442003
"my aunt , " she continued , "is going to morrow into that part of the town , and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street. 3.715722048572559
i do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain. 3.210111114677711
contact the foundation as set forth in section Number below. 3.552225042669063
" "you may as well call it impertinence at once. 3.0171585407386936
" "i must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied jane , "and i hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together. 3.4932803275027684
his character was decided. 2.9084092210754786
" "why will you think so ? it must be his own doing. 3.9104918456198545
she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge. 3.9210375088900165
" "yes , " replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , "but that was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance. 3.5192508478336597
- "i , who have prided myself on my discernment ! i , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust. 3.6585387977809893
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. 3.269369356943893
it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. 3.631541929780268
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances : and to have Mr collins instead ! her liveliness had been never worse timed. 2.9267088601225826
Mr darcy 's behaviour astonished and vexed her. 3.2982811560557606
" "are you , indeed ? and pray what sort of guardians do you make ? does your charge give you much trouble ? young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way. 3.0902806681296147
Mr gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education. 3.6062427650498505
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy 's meditated elopement. 3.275524780468304
is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? a glass of wine ; shall i get you one ? you are very ill. 3.7532532180897875
but do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr darcy ? " "they are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine. 3.5411371858807166
rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother inlaw 's intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. 4.417397052438002
Mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise. 3.8125967098617926
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield. 3.3477362571835636
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good naturedly engaged Mr collins 's conversation to herself. 3.6082120819583055
this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it. 3.4750704728663178
" "an excellent consolation in its way , " said elizabeth , "but it will not do for us. 3.4080580834624867
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman 's of superior execution. 3.397559236233892
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. 3.762662196100873
" "and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice. 3.287332842152013
to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley. 4.1607564977600635
but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. 4.363536920324359
consider how important every moment is , in such a case. 4.38381512187002
"it must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year. 3.245092681363486
" elizabeth was forced to go. 2.8761054102972756
your mother insists upon your accepting it. 3.276007374281646
" the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while. 3.6505828246909235
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking. 3.5400065169069643
he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , "it is above eight months. 3.8958161333149572
Mr collins 's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete. 3.3124781903332825
" "not at all , " he replied ; "they were brightened by the exercise. 3.339813911159792
b. 2.8443557756472804
kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia 's last letter , she had prepared her for such a step. 4.436118870526825
in revolving lady catherine 's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. 3.86250846120138
" this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham 's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. 3.6241160834153265
jane 's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart. 3.9021884668886915
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds. 3.486859720688841
" "go , my dear , " cried her mother , "and shew her ladyship about the different walks. 3.1982524628903697
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady 's whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away. 4.458740957784484
how does georgiana get on , darcy ? " Mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister 's proficiency. 3.741197023439275
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way. 4.01834587965036
elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room. 3.576440029180918
"and then , " said she , "if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. 3.3980633797448148
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in. 3.4979264636606135
" "you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr darcy. 3.1508469999848554
that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny. 3.943231988601526
their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush. 4.233860891944589
" "but if you have got them to day , " said elizabeth , "my mother 's purpose will be answered. 3.294713780882145
" "indeed you are mistaken. 3.752117468995262
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley , "i can guess the subject of your reverie. 3.976731520664331
he replied , and was again silent. 4.881204843898994
" "thank you , " said lydia , "for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry. 4.07744782788829
his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days time. 3.5945762761199465
" "remember , eliza , that he does not know jane 's disposition as you do. 3.977750055586374
" "well , " cried her mother , "it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents. 3.7179426890326774
" the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit. 3.785971115718886
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth 's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word. 3.1972465687864458
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone. 3.4626586595745845
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia 's connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to every thing ? impossible. 3.4055419737026935
she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard. 3.2535732086504887
elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane 's being in the fairest way for happiness. 4.35322261398947
her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms. 4.105541622921537
my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last. 4.0669176685714135
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable. 3.3956034191751514
Mr darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me. 3.880503120237722
" elizabeth asked questions in vain ; maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate. 3.274686481335951
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate. 3.4330822027171406
Number. 2.239615789728809
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight. 3.400048558264396
risk any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence. 3.6150187209254163
chapter iii. 2.2111971152442003
- "louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr hurst. 4.490711415744025
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley 's inattention. 3.732794931012654
" "la ! you are so strange ! but i must tell you how it went off. 3.5893059897643846
after a short pause , her companion added , "you are too generous to trifle with me. 2.7962019937151785
its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn. 3.777506204590092
"but so we all do. 3.6956310195806314
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections. 3.3633420302719665
her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines. 3.1898266245421687
it should not be said , that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. 4.629386945927975
" "i must not decide on my own performance. 3.0213877062288406
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. 3.6353679724070855
" "believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire. 3.2329078399466775
on being made acquainted with the present Mr darcy 's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman 's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy. 3.89724179479443
" "and quite alone ? have all her friends left her ? " " Mrs annesley is with her. 3.433293678798349
they followed her into the dining parlour. 3.4302838179187094
i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle. 3.499218166229216
wretched , wretched , mistake ! " darcy made no answer. 3.156456408179106
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. 4.196574575217995
those who do not complain are never pitied. 3.369507115139698
your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather. 3.4287912485717054
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though i am sure (and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole. 4.173549986114679
to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed. 3.8594984523218874
it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side. 3.301426185281302
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother 's right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , "ah ! jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman. 3.5663016588876357
the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church , and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now. 3.659051855657035
yes , miss bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. 3.6788026863458105
it was agreed to. 3.5422846675206836
with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round. 4.430917866460846
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " "oh , yes ! you will only think i feel more than i ought to do , when i tell you all. 3.6187771092319627
the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr bingley ? " "when i am in the country , " he replied , "i never wish to leave it ; and when i am in town it is pretty much the same. 3.988257787152745
" "upon my word , " said her ladyship , "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. 3.0606761531793243
" "oh ! you mean jane , i suppose because he danced with her twice. 3.127817275422515
as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Mr darcy , and Mr darcy only , entered the room. 3.6858059086663677
"and pray may i ask ? " but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , "is it in address that he improves ? has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? for i dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , "that he is improved in essentials. 3.5509885655680824
" then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , "unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex. 3.5559093393053534
i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , i have seen nothing of it. 3.2848956391703688
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " "if we are ever able to learn what wickham 's debts have been , " said elizabeth , "and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own. 3.453174017495932
" "and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ? " "the indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting. 3.2487063234844733

there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects. 3.931674013872235
well , but now for my news : it is about dear wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? there is no danger of wickham 's marrying mary king. 3.852362899657464

it was all pride and insolence. 3.3262350583066174
mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. 3.2947874954851044
elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill. 3.2621680103874278
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. 3.473758939756668
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family. 3.953233374231508
a flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. 3.8780891757320632
she then took a large house in edward street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. 3.271174028123839
Mr bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other. 3.774723025855249
"a place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected. 3.694798685697858
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr bingley 's name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged. 3.5155145318456156
and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia 's relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount. 3.788004610315727
you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it. 3.1841725697664693
" "i beg your pardon , " replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer. 3.4992806162675665
" they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and Mr gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist Mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia. 3.4671850096605916
it was an animating subject , and Mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. 2.751354265796494
colonel fitzwilliam 's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out. 3.7460976045184826
elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes. 3.888834260154028
Mr bennet 's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother 's fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his. 4.122241737536545
" "my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents. 3.3554059917025487
she is not such a simpleton. 3.6107652618245583
" charlotte 's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth. 3.315781993569041
but the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me. 3.8562187489032
he immediately offered to fetch her others ; all that his library afforded. 3.9249431453855865
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted. 3.5086703363806193
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end. 3.7023944977872127
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour. 3.7469720071847
at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself. 3.306007500640608
" "it is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill. 3.5853413307981907
"pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried colonel fitzwilliam. 3.904704914654033
it would have been strange if they had. 3.655702503991933
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , "i did not know before that you ever walked this way. 3.7418504392648058
if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him. 3.441000350516238
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post. 3.7891654504716943
but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham 's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate. 3.280376980142874
it was to this effect : "since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well. 3.131686258205767
elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word. 2.730531313167252
" the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed rooms , were all that remained to be shewn. 2.967535436235935
they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. 3.206354340211901
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous. 3.464058451854114
"there is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , "who more particularly wishes to be known to you , will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? " the surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. 3.4281317549936707
" "yes , very indifferent indeed , " said elizabeth , laughingly. 2.8849569379671793
these causes must be stated , though briefly. 4.5483211947420745
elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. 3.596148188574841
but what is that to me ? if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh. 3.5436517714210356
she would not listen therefore to her daughter 's proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable. 3.4571822330225106
"well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , "and what do you think of my husband ? is not he a charming man ? i am sure my sisters must all envy me. 3.3604035648966235
" the girls stared at their father. 3.305592000319308
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming. 4.027215198077165
sir william did not say much. 3.570413622622695
as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte 's sake , she made more favourable than it really was. 3.9592250210068056
the subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. 3.8392351728257608
e. 2.515032492749843
"is miss darcy much grown since the spring ? " said miss bingley ; "will she be as tall as i am ? " "i think she will. 3.8184414118907344
"with my mother up stairs. 3.975955591445598
Mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley 's visit in gracechurch street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance. 3.350918774188117
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to elizabeth , said , "miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room. 3.7519936895628874
" "write to me very often , my dear. 4.1148976871166205
" Mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , "may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr and Mrs collins well. 3.184662431682974
" "i can much more easily believe Mr bingley 's being imposed on , than that Mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony. 3.559337512879325
i am sure you must feel it so. 3.1926590431672612
i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings. 3.555533086382855
i speak feelingly. 3.6611861741768443
it must be an amusing study. 4.415653626218143
" she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her. 3.4182516201349546
" "some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me. 3.4654640960105803
i knew nothing at all of lady catherine 's connections. 3.9206781620397777
f. 2.7829467218352515
but against this , there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered. 4.494513331451349
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one 's own daughters i cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr collins too ! why should he have it more than anybody else ? " "i leave it to yourself to determine , " said Mr bennet. 3.5186030934921204
if you 'll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight. 3.6697952339940803
but i know the foundation is unjust. 3.5380182944473417
"he only told me , what i have now told you. 3.8648303495554286
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but elizabeth , less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte 's , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. 3.6413950796664163
lady catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way. 3.6735661491389564
Mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began. 3.4667268313038977

lady catherine then observed , "your father 's estate is entailed on Mr collins , i think. 3.4591426019900675
with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Mr wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. 4.2190242332411865
Mr collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family. 3.8740070420626225
" Mr bennet made no answer. 2.4281118430007798
i would go and see her , if i could have the carriage. 4.263316482878658
his family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion. 4.236119595265159
attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham. 4.463788419912296
at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , " Mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain. 3.6225642343066684
" "but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? " "you must decide for yourself , " said elizabeth , "and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him. 3.4166983054554874
" "colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia 's side , but nothing to give him any alarm. 3.3347243086902547
elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply. 3.7554765825124186
Mr hurst and Mr bingley were at piquet , and Mrs hurst was observing their game. 4.217250225518867
it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself. 3.458532305364654
she was going to the butcher 's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed. 4.159768262636752
"but surely , " said she , "i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me. 3.9012011372913684
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought. 3.6846495734899234
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer. 3.6923194321031874
in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin. 3.32508326574366

but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead. 3.3598609514208944
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister. 3.134461093368461
"what is Mr darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ? i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear. 3.953200683822067
"it is a long time , Mr bingley , since you went away , " said Mrs bennet. 3.7617385343686083
lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , "do you know , mama , that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard , and if he does , colonel forster will hire him. 3.6201217063529607
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them. 3.80118196540251
" he then told her of georgiana 's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend. 3.2735289677680868
i am most seriously displeased. 3.3961865916664276
" " you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said Mr darcy , looking at the eldest miss bennet. 4.013174060830935
Mrs bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could. 3.829028107023651

lydia 's being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites. 3.8183079707725316
"he has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , "by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! i had not believed it possible. 3.7486886806475996

kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; (by the bye , Mrs forster and me are such friends ! ) and so she asked the two harringtons to come , but harriet was ill , and so pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? we dressed up chamberlayne in woman 's clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun ! not a soul knew of it , but col. 3.678939887579485
with many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , "good lord ! sir william , how can you tell such a story ? do not you know that Mr collins wants to marry lizzy ? " nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william 's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy. 3.540888863738174
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way. 3.375520016332336
to know that her daughter would be married was enough. 3.66020815810002
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book. 4.113488992178075
Mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street. 3.474875666437857

my mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much i suffer from what she says. 3.846665348771652
but Mr gardiner could not be seen , and Mr darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning. 4.1647381479743455
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected. 3.4685340158682845
there he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself. 4.514486379019069
" Mr gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday. 3.784043504722411
whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth 's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr darcy approaching them , and at no great distance. 4.91674700983421
i shall go distracted. 3.37280853895468
no one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection. 3.1709079725982314
elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation. 3.920628951728333
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him. 3.4159153994116886
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. 3.366234318041974
happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over ! " "i wish i could say any thing to comfort you , " replied elizabeth ; "but it is wholly out of my power. 3.825002112335822
Mrs bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure jane would have caught cold again. 3.3786109728609666
it was hardly enough ; but it pleased her. 3.975872422764329

your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from Mr wickham. 4.016951271380873
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman. 3.422912091996566

it was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , "say nothing of that. 3.427771662497951
"did you speak from your own observation , " said she , "when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? " "from the former. 3.335430847678332
" jane then took it from her pocket book , and gave it to elizabeth. 3.3763163349083443
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. 3.992288402470033
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. 3.4798769049923854
i take up my pen again to do , what i have just told you i would not , but circumstances are such , that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible. 4.060129232793123
i wonder when you would have spoken , if i had not asked you ! my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect. 3.3924924838628563
i have by no means done. 3.832912875020678
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. 3.240006589244354
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr darcy 's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road. 3.6578074937154073
"i have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech. 3.4635080305455475
on his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , "let me call your maid. 3.622275981757857
" "that is exactly what i should have supposed of you , " said elizabeth. 3.0455200290567666
she was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle 's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe. 3.665068839881679
Mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me. 3.0128799096238166
" "i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. 4.283526549199091
wont it , kitty ? " kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. 4.066830158273659
elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him ; she really rejoiced at it. 3.431421556823756
" "whatever my connections may be , " said elizabeth , "if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you. 3.521538653405519
but who was your mother ? who are your uncles and aunts ? do not imagine me ignorant of their condition. 3.651587011952867
there was no help for it however. 3.3604575655416093
the loo table , however , did not appear. 4.081000981351965
he promises fairly , and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent. 3.809544485793134
"do you prefer reading to cards ? " said he ; "that is rather singular. 3.4110555253513084
on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided. 3.1647653166391727
charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. 3.3041285782094865
i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all. 3.61471026923389

Mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it. 3.6392865436884634
elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes. 3.9259814203085748
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself , some shelves in the closets up stairs. 3.733658857317791
but of course she did not mention my name to you. 3.7807568305472063
there is something very pompous in his style. 3.2918765401608567
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth. 3.3100810797682345
much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married. 3.8902553822696206
but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own. 3.569596719018677
women fancy admiration means more than it does. 3.8076138268778337
my father , however , is partial to Mr wickham. 4.314153331714585
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me. 3.5635738158016035
elizabeth 's courage did not fail her. 2.9530447740198382

had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr darcy , the gardener 's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it. 3.5452907601596446
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. 4.021558215843205

Mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else. 3.6792952638518317
as they drove to Mr gardiner 's door , jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. 3.6157352074685747
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress. 3.142507777264246
"i see your design , bingley , " said his friend. 4.055576784555587
but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art. 4.835356999979072
" "let me write for you , " said jane , "if you dislike the trouble yourself. 3.3733593266067317
i will read it to you "when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. 3.5350299281263355
elizabeth could not help saying , "it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so. 3.797234357857659

" "my dear sir , " replied Mr collins , "i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship 's concurrence. 3.208226805547309
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. 3.3964191694718973
i do think Mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : i like them prodigiously. 3.257127795919118

" when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend 's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr bingley for his sister. 4.184042136207416
and what do you think she said besides ? 'ah ! Mrs bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last. 3.633819943643517
" "upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except netherfield. 2.938878180316203

by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song. 3.255017547170624
i dare say Mr bingley will be very glad to see you ; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy. 3.505166177858216
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother 's being an inmate of Mr darcy 's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture. 4.130748145526072
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure. 4.205958505907008
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour. 3.0626235571029934
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion. 3.5400984733256844
"i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter. 3.197256587569278
this was one point , with regard to lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. 4.289833430377439

"how can you be smiling so , lizzy ? " their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago. 3.2505380800365

after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr and Mrs gardiner , though unknown. 4.058070827038893

after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , "is not this nice ? is not this an agreeable surprise ? " "and we mean to treat you all , " added lydia ; "but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there. 3.2002852262969768

at first there seemed danger of lydia 's engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular. 3.676958524545568
Mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. 3.6946042898857963

"i admire all my three sons inlaw highly , " said he. 3.5269751499307977
" "i am grieved , indeed , " cried darcy ; "grieved shocked. 3.3276875099140026
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. 3.3550097034260475
she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success. 3.6701063842059574
Mr bennet 's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. 3.5602996344353492
this was very amiable , but charlotte 's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of ; its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Mr collins 's addresses , by engaging them towards herself. 3.362577005470039
" "i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied elizabeth , "but it is not in my power to accept it. 3.341937811903389
indeed , Mr darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear. 4.040752702000602
they travelled as expeditiously as possible ; and sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinner time the next day. 3.583510187164325
" "but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model. 3.1837547070739665
Mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them. 3.3882690419317454
not that i care about it , though. 3.8913542657677778
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with "it is your turn to say something now , Mr darcy. 3.2708718095535274

Mrs bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband 's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income. 3.1339688357811593
the first part of Mrs gardiner 's business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. 3.386797046918296
" mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how. 3.4936004547003217
" "can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? " "yes. 3.420957398850837
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain. 3.8512542466198405
Mr bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters. 3.5000479950435857
i could hardly keep my countenance. 3.665591649102615
" "i do , i do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , "i love him. 3.5197258470663852
but , perhaps he could not in her mother 's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. 3.7078144342387533
james 's , sir william was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look. 4.01607089149523
no thanks to his gallantry for that. 3.5278018344415187
when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish. 3.7548554077184324
the hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs bennet 's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. 3.7175784732936474
that is all to be forgot. 3.373433032250143
"did it , " said he , "did it soon make you think better of me ? did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? " she explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed. 3.6132935445800567
elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation. 3.2805627555211627
"i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that. 3.2633520040254043
" "your humility , Mr bingley , " said elizabeth , "must disarm reproof. 3.521295104530164
but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her. 3.7588271592827214

the same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening. 3.2395728393025993
they could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant 's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for Mr darcy. 4.239483037483076
"i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places. 3.4440332529078663

it was my brother gardiner 's drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. 3.341021995493914
on their being joined by Mr bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery. 3.735117188221097
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. 3.211131444550225
she now lost every expectation of pleasure. 3.623761700401491
he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of Mr darcy. 3.573012422231698
her carriage remained at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it. 3.6888979566564224
you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? " "blame you ! oh , no. 4.1335257391294125
he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday. 3.767707543310029
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy 's marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth. 3.608737615464056
my visit was not long , as caroline and Mrs hurst were going out. 3.718659229108396
it became her turn to listen. 3.7675652456002307
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; and the kind of half expectation which Mrs gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing. 3.654607939894149
" miss bennet paused a little and then replied , "surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. 3.185848339920711
"i am sure , " she added , "if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with. 4.30640162036928
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself. 4.121369707027825
" elizabeth almost stared at her. 3.1251299763367615

" "oh ! then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. 3.304155696529042
the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which Mr collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship 's desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. 4.048821857802091
the pause was to elizabeth 's feelings dreadful. 3.9857816596522953
while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes. 3.1338891992233506
Mr philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. 3.337488184050228

he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. 3.5796743878769117
vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self destined to another. 3.4478816479579235
sir william staid only a week at hunsford ; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter 's being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. 3.73106121207931

your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month. 3.997706037259055
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks. 3.102362278343691
the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome. 4.015525346546438

on finding Mrs bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , "may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? " before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Mrs bennet instantly answered , "oh dear ! yescertainly. 3.87045311852316

"i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried jane. 3.1978855169011284
could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ? his temptation is not adequate to the risk. 3.3240215170733474

" on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , "did not you think , Mr darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ? " "with great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic. 3.642729922092195

_ dear sir , the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since i have had the misfortune to lose him , i have frequently wished to heal the breach ; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance. 4.030768509915215
besides , there was truth in his looks. 4.544765869199618
miss bingley 's civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former. 3.917395854661061

after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , "but tell me all and every thing about it , which i have not already heard. 3.7492890104722756

it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. 3.969217124944197
"is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ? " "not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months. 3.5408204224269153

when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in maria 's astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small. 3.6853942327587554
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs bingley and talked of Mrs darcy may be guessed. 3.1305956578001815
the invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine 's drawing room. 3.4798234263377363
but , alas ! the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin 's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question. 3.421886685033705

the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady 's fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister 's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. 3.8243884801009713
"it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single. 3.137964664119651
on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book. 3.6930786219774854
georgiana 's reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved. 3.415395018829101
all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation. 3.173882870882932
Mrs bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of. 3.316863027718024
i am sure you will be very comfortable there. 3.7024370557408197
but however he did not. 3.933772591669385
" "your first position is false. 3.49975004270205
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister 's infamous elopement. 3.3893654382736487
Mrs bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces. 4.091964279448795
you know i have. 3.3106140226604963
" elizabeth turned away to hide a smile. 3.8824499943453796
i know we dine with four and twenty families. 3.052234887749947
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion 's justifying her coming so far alone. 3.673483748547284
who should suffer but myself ? it has been my own doing , and i ought to feel it. 4.328805162867732
but tell me , what did you come down to netherfield for ? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequence ? " "my real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me. 3.5330364378970134
i have no such injuries to resent. 3.846967696415086
but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation. 3.723086101224212
and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. 3.5977793602950547
nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts. 3.870776121286311
it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain. 3.3528084812873487
i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. 3.5599343236636836
" elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment 's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. 3.3448835312172567
we seem to have been designed for each other. 3.5416314771091084
" he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading Mr collins 's letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , "if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure. 3.5418830267318
and what sort of table do they keep ? charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say. 3.187586222820048
" "perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and Mr robinson ; did not i mention it to you ? Mr robinson 's asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question oh ! the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point. 3.5146545157269915
" "that is very strange. 2.92594258321375
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. 3.343658712645303
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. 3.212778642486797
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body. 3.4028480615509564
when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. 3.6701912381496866
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day. 4.047867398946679
Mr jones says we must not think of moving her. 3.8777105860611623
"she is so fond of Mrs forster , " said she , "it will be quite shocking to send her away ! and there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much. 3.5980847151548745
this , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother 's proposal ; and it was settled that Mr jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better. 3.7124408209297073
" in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. 3.700679193835116
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each. 4.146823965840734
i only hope they may have half my good luck. 3.381506304804624
her mother 's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth 's mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family. 3.8351425698244057
" "i cannot believe it. 2.9851576495345418
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement , you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph Number. 2.95304859430141
perhaps i am not doing her justice. 3.8695121246205977
jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected. 3.788849817890159
an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family. 4.631789721993558
" "oh ! yes , " said elizabeth drily " Mr darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him. 3.4448994062792524
- that is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter. 3.022318048737807
" elizabeth smiled. 3.4438064983706447
" kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry. 3.963242462624185
they have at least that advantage. 3.4801801199291296
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness. 4.3099945052308595
every body is disgusted with his pride. 4.208495269526413
you may ask questions , which i shall not choose to answer. 3.9164548222654467
charles , when you build your house , i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley. 3.7770807274963705
" elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him that Mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance. 3.5038783763874384
her ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her 's , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary. 3.8570891121338917
" "you are over scrupulous surely. 2.9221593926509
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that. 2.9169093571741227
stop me whilst you can. 3.4406893391722098
she could think of nothing else , and yet whether bingley 's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of jane 's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister 's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded. 3.4529173534188624
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her. 3.101550662013965
no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy. 3.322456622572201
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth 's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste. 3.4180317970155665
" "lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use. 4.020648584527162
mary and kitty were both with Mrs bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all. 3.555548752769341
having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. 3.5367855066541707
"my dear brother , "at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope will give you satisfaction. 3.4439323775250488
" she held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house. 3.5643824884131887
his former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. 4.159944336310746
" elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs. 3.4292075094559205
are you going much farther ? " "no , i should have turned in a moment. 3.4033908507428166
"while i can have my mornings to myself , " said she , "it is enough. 3.4118630810389665
f. 2.7829467218352515
you are safe from me. 3.2571416598817433
you had much better dance. 3.731784389649033
" "with all my heart ; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it. 3.1443258803469076
" "with the officers ! " cried lydia. 3.45758093703412
very few days passed in which Mr collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. 3.849123350433274
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr bingley. 3.388328523519547
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it. 3.102552512146473
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness. 3.3914952891431667
" away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech. 3.358958991992176
Mr and Mrs collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance. 3.392922380647313
as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. 3.0699953720558106
after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Mr collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer. 3.3253554672083783
Mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year. 3.3338930254619132
" " Mr bingley does not know Mr wickham himself ? " "no ; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton. 3.320913646445953
do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. 3.813720854138991
i am excessively attentive to all those things. 3.125853314531449
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing 's park , when he put his letter into her hand ! she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it. 3.254153375898076
chapter vi. 3.0991478320975108
"of what are you talking ? " "of Mr collins and lizzy. 3.575608582066357
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. 4.631936397385238
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too ! ) on this subject ; and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh 's foot stool , that she said , ' Mr collins , you must marry. 4.122637442649507
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Mrs collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered. 3.288092025204218
so , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next. 3.6351294194806405
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them. 3.2396481217216446
if an individual work is in the public domain in the united states and you are located in the united states , we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying , distributing , performing , displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg are removed. 3.057973274501755
" "i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these. 2.7765311416693144
to miss lydia bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing. 3.703408747147821
but no , " recollecting herself , - "that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : i should not have been allowed to invite them. 3.4772459106695117
if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough. 4.26010255646146
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men. 3.5884136118707533
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time. 3.521639470494339
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother 's ear. 3.4907939974156577
the evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary. 4.131701738705164
but it is so strange ! " " yes that is what makes it amusing. 3.251405612945723
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before. 3.221258584288132
i knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them. 3.3840418832320207
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did i receive in the mean time. 3.2308952555011747
i must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music. 3.472007458899765
she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , "i am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! what do you think has happened this morning ? Mr collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him. 3.3965218720284454
but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited. 3.969553394162732
in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london. 3.7824609172457873
" "you know nothing of the matter. 2.9811409120506602
" Mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. 3.414038099511519
i am perfectly satisfied. 2.8615760998400197
this match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place. 4.40790219456203
and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. 3.2854765547612774
they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight. 3.5521822787544406
" "let me be rightly understood. 3.041506071175149
for about three years i heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. 4.01318846867105
when this was done , she had a less active part to play. 3.9063119404031754
" elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match. 3.9931446807823234
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet i think it is well expressed. 3.3105824210849506
the miss webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your 's. 3.4937908343054076
" "i hope not so. 3.253200267503396
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it. 3.676843029611484
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine. 4.279942418939277
"upon my word , " said Mrs gardiner , "i begin to be of your uncle 's opinion. 3.8754428654505575
but does not jane correspond with the sister ? she will not be able to help calling. 4.311131151296665
that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! oh , lydia ! " "i comfort myself with thinking , " replied jane , "that he certainly would not marry lydia , if he had not a real regard for her. 3.4095498520221423
"the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , i hope , improved in civility. 3.745030098459526
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. 3.018281481358856
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure. 3.6372710215849526
but now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground. 3.3264539156744197
Mr bingley was good looking and gentleman like ; he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners. 3.366908734467445
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ? " elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here ; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible. 3.593850809377801
" her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it. 3.8517180623189273
she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne 's. 4.087684470039407
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced. 3.5605766422018363
" elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them. 3.6163560574173874
they agreed that Mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman 's conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together. 3.4650653591971174
when the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother 's rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party. 3.913323725341458
"two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge. 4.257352624765641
she could think of nothing but of Mr wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor Mr collins were once silent. 3.350821600058418
i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. 3.881201843277161
i have nothing to say against him ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better. 4.086104147767323
neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane. 3.1041944784299713
" some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from longbourn would come in the evening. 3.8202158837437814
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. 2.9394134525312077
she saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers. 4.280152884232862
Mr darcy walked off ; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. 3.5034014893999834
a scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation. 3.4557728722334056
the next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour 's tête àtête with Mrs bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed on. 3.2304008627409853
charlotte 's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. 3.4294951445740542

"haye park might do , " said she , "if the gouldings would quit it , or the great house at stoke , if the drawing room were larger ; but ashworth is too far off ! i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for purvis lodge , the attics are dreadful. 4.236606991206916
"he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle. 4.087950275501249
she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. 3.6696556873518227
i know it all ; that the young man 's marrying her , was a patched up business , at the expence of your father and uncles. 3.8096233137097646
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother. 5.173735925890286
her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. 3.7660717717599272
my mother was in hysterics , and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done ! but the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties. 4.023128004714784
this however was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. 3.5866155159938518
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley 's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself. 3.6606588899646146
let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood. 3.98307809379728
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility. 3.116071393643361
Mr hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep. 4.348463644284019
Mr darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding. 3.549412880855182

the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr wickham 's charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice. 3.6206035866611237
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment. 3.917368034641858
Mr darcy said very little , and Mr hurst nothing at all. 3.7233151595539002

the family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them. 3.7384796843508212
" my mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at easter , i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh , widow of sir lewis de bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england. 3.577936614850128

Mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day. 3.322095043812001
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here ; and i was convinced of her affection. 3.5642261789035854

as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them. 3.4262066569564036
i shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance i require. 3.509271213001293
as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. 3.2327641147695356
i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together. 4.045682208658392

"what a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr darcy ! there is nothing like dancing after all. 3.570769267661427
" "but not before they went to brighton ? " "no , i believe not. 3.75458973481416
" "i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried elizabeth. 3.059028425602721
Mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it. 3.5694013692313264
" "has she been presented ? i do not remember her name among the ladies at court. 3.6138747338920085
" "you are quite right. 2.7810954217226427
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr darcy returned within the stated time. 3.235546040236559
his belief of her sister 's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. 3.6713548217496683
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else. 3.4121496900768835
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. 3.630451969443924

to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long. 4.11427042549972

however , i recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr darcy might have done as well. 3.661822667550375
elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr darcy. 3.380203538471723

Mr and Mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant 's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy. 3.3675195520967605
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh 's being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light. 3.046163768035483
" "you appear to me , Mr darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. 3.557197158976799
this Mrs younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town. 4.066121454806363
" 'tis too much ! " she added , "by far too much. 3.5518635218696564
Mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off. 3.14475281093389
eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress. 3.6078234388996244
it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen 's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. 3.5926235397100017
elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough. 3.3028136497297376
" elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr bingley 's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them. 3.1504983976736

"read it aloud , " said their father , "for i hardly know myself what it is about. 4.129975742402942
he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine 's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. 3.7979309431265436
"what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia ! " she cried. 3.367661462156162
elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. 3.833850223081183
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him. 2.9453176284231977
lydia was exceedingly fond of him. 3.1503591468740355

"i am glad i bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox ! well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home. 3.4900217265778783
had elizabeth 's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. 3.383541386619452
the dejection was almost universal. 3.3488629821509948
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes. 3.830457792411479
intending to trace their route. 3.945285995154032
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , "oh ! mamma , do the people here abouts know i am married to day ? i was afraid they might not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like any thing. 3.7490651590451742
she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse. 3.2429267847643635
i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country. 3.4999775639657518
but these things happen so often ! a young man , such as you describe Mr bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent. 4.033918010834481
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune. 3.5438797814488217
if i have wounded your sister 's feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them. 3.7666045815773925
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet , with a polite congratulation ; Mr hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was "very glad ; " but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley 's salutation. 3.547134724237556
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging. 3.937271644507753
" Mr bingley followed his advice. 3.3368953805364843
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character. 4.006391352883814
she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. 3.7320690677142787
it is every way horrible ! " darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence. 3.418875697004131
my dear jane , Mr collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as i do ; and you must feel , as well as i do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking. 3.7615046810254467
no , never. 4.1435079000875685
yet he knew to the contrary himself. 3.6736518834958525
" elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card table , and stationed herself between Mr bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game. 3.5410611244175216
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt 's arrival. 3.27267806246309
at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , "and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting ! i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , i am thus rejected. 3.719955139839584
" and with a bow to Mr darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. 3.6974272304869555
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? " "will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? " "by all means , " cried bingley ; "let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of. 3.404103517760144
you are charmingly group 'd , and appear to uncommon advantage. 4.235732440500985
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. 3.1884322525816597
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me. 3.3768340092873013
the tête àtête surprised them. 3.442677544827758
they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering. 3.82822205322984

" "upon my word ! well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know. 2.996161897525514

i dare say the lace upon Mrs hurst 's gown " here she was interrupted again. 3.155272248528316
poor jane ! i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately. 3.8651933841876867
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but i was over ruled , as i always am. 4.546079560186594

" "yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near cheapside. 3.4026421337255424
had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. 3.3076436881802986
you may depend upon my seeking no further. 2.8604779044728255
" then taking the disengaged arm of Mr darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself. 3.3597386205386224
he enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done. 3.8884193823314526
they walked on , without knowing in what direction. 3.6963421385200252
sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. 3.5976642454590304
Mr darcy replied with great intrepidity , "miss elizabeth bennet. 3.5903025000889803
the more i see of the world , the more am i dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense. 3.8366316099735616
there was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. 3.8981786965437006
"there is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said kitty ; "who can it be ? " "some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose ; i am sure i do not know. 4.091060283484574
her hopes were answered ; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. 3.6521186880155616
he has more to give. 3.514040844015692
Mr collins made his declaration in form. 3.1445685940318557
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said , "i was surprised to see darcy in town last month. 3.738433209974726
chapter xviii. 3.7971831107950407
he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business. 3.8610493338554965
but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph. 4.767911360156712
she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns. 4.389147127344037
" chapter iv. 2.4110914932864635
" elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. 3.1955956821097034
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me. 3.6041661896677124
poor charlotte ! it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! but she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion. 3.9085610184962003
steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her. 3.6428967010262694
"sure he will not leave london before he has found them. 3.645074863132802
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters. 3.0930814783068894
yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête àtête was over. 3.070545189849462
i came to try you. 3.3158565758078655
in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. 3.6027266333922388
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother 's. 4.1271525223606975
but jane was to go home with her , and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation. 4.297488120241894
in that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to Mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. 4.433211293769732
Mrs bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was. 3.2082550246171397
thank heaven ! i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. 3.492455214113105

Mr collins 's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. 3.260385920253843
before any answer could arrive from Mr collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth , from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge. 4.238695333028125
" no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. 3.77312635924644
everything wore a happier aspect. 3.444265705440767
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased. 3.2451243434578214
e. 2.515032492749843
" "oh ! my dear brother , " replied Mrs bennet , "that is exactly what i could most wish for. 3.564598170997536
and to be kept back on such a motive ! i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind. 3.5009803246305022
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself. 4.819864048913014
" "it may do very well for the others , " replied Mr bingley ; "but i am sure it will be too much for kitty. 4.099737948351414
well , much good may it do them ! and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead. 2.9213992079044253
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor. 3.1597150511745284
Mrs gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head. 3.0508997090978025
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford. 3.3640861227881
she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended. 3.5054990718691026
but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves. 3.13529010790401
oh ! that i had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone. 3.5788376533305315
to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit U R L while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. 2.889512159980946
he heard her with astonishment. 2.9505964025570126
from the farther disadvantage of lydia 's society she was of course carefully kept , and though Mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going. 3.531939196105463
" "i did not think you would ; and that being the case , i cannot consider your situation with much compassion. 3.571459209780911
it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your ' s seems to have been. 3.5474130683422826
"he is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , "that ever lived. 4.016846044934234
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , "when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood. 3.350425866396359
"you are joking , lizzy. 3.7690150417698725
"oh ! lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! if i could but see you as happy ! if there were but such another man for you ! " "if you were to give me forty such men , i never could be so happy as you. 3.5978503681099605
Mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world. 3.5066870010362963
but you know married women have never much time for writing. 3.0774315076452874
for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? " "oh ! " cried elizabeth , "i am excessively diverted. 3.42576604931839
i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ; i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason. 3.2070076893198163
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ; and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks. 3.443442936062411
you must and shall be married by a special licence. 2.9499193250174183
"i am sure there is not on his. 3.591124175549332
if you mention my name at the bell , you will be attended to. 3.3572292412099944
and yet , upon my honour , i believed what i said of myself to be true , and i believe it at this moment. 3.734188205495464
the garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving. 4.792468440125127
having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. 3.994971498756851
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as i could. 3.4421756423042047
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure. 3.5834022779016914
Mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth. 3.1371669311471626
" "i should imagine not. 2.9605906120209764
what congratulations will then flow in ! i appeal to Mr darcy : but let me not interrupt you , sir. 3.5582229446920026
"i am , dear sir , &c. 3.306145737892673
"that is all very proper and civil , i am sure , " said Mrs bennet , "and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman. 3.964318049683988
Mrs bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness. 2.9711615300098675
she has two nieces of her own. 3.6939620231103087
her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. 3.7192124967468745
" it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now. 3.007082920720635
she is all affability and condescension , and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. 3.8430765187178575
and who knows what may happen ? but that is nothing to us. 3.515900000985178
ii. 5.205180961085702
lydia 's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten ; every sister except mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr collins was to attend them , at the request of Mr bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Mr bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at hunsford. 3.8235331862467534
" "miss bennet , do you know who i am ? i have not been accustomed to such language as this. 3.573100412191555
it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go. 3.283460534964727
but it is of small importance. 3.690357745780518
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all Number states of the united states. 3.407742226391247
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have still something more to ask of the former. 3.7259353196764082
he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr and Mrs collins 's happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too. 3.5455650322814978
why jane you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! well , i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see Mr bingley. 3.498983376462045
the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. 3.723501913388756
" "care of him ! yes , i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care. 3.3677866017896894
but of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. 3.6608958520413446
it cannot be done too much ; and when i next write to her , i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. 4.088528773944214
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt. 3.978075750767397
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that she would not give into it. 3.9568006747384445
on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared. 3.774152270142155
" "your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family , " said elizabeth , coolly , "will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence. 4.1090278409871726
but the gloom of lydia 's prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton. 3.4977500854769072
i did not wink at you. 4.023478700145344
he was most highly esteemed by Mr darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend. 3.803593644273831
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern. 3.432803475425214
such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined. 3.524975070960816
"kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room. 3.218894722936161
kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. 3.4174507785551054
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. 3.1941002135957834
Number. 2.239615789728809
the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings. 3.8839877686503588
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical. 3.5706529462632424
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous. 3.5062874043790457
" * * * * * it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey. 2.977756141473938
into one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance. 3.618747386644969
i feel as if i had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve. 3.584054616293395
and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ? did she call to refuse her consent ? " to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it. 3.581966368586167
he was very fond of them. 3.440409478085081
lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , "i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern. 4.078111549060331
" "my dear , " replied her husband , "i have two small favours to request. 3.9815367928771175
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. 3.0160752819049703
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room. 3.1673968729620414
" "it is evident by this , " added jane , "that he comes back no more this winter. 3.214775603987221
it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two. 3.4961468290348257
the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again. 3.3967488992703148
in another minute Mr bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend. 3.7366065790124896
no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. 3.439634119184008
to Mr and Mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. 3.293677118599534
stay , stay , i will go myself. 4.872431005356098
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. 3.6397945142555104
if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence. 3.0517817505322418
Mrs long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not. 3.534992135707608
" from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr darcy had been over rated , elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs gardiner 's long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : "i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , i was too cross to write. 3.7422305817113166
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was Mrs hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. 3.6504594131076336
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. 4.374615454261081
" "no , that i am sure i shall not ; and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical. 4.451149549531365
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty. 3.218724451432986
"or in other words , you are determined to have him. 3.6462905872786124
" "how i long to see her again ! i never met with anybody who delighted me so much. 3.003735196798868
"my dear friend , "if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day 's tête àtête between two women can never end without a quarrel. 3.3343473605870897
when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister. 4.257577318506145
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse ; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable. 3.1460828132609984
she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks. 3.5998340693563087
c. 2.8443557756472804
Mr darcy 's letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. 3.694169561605113
Mrs bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph. 3.045397934474735
but , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if i still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. 3.271043465822398
he meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it. 3.9833189673858427
london : printed for t. 2.178119202159798
you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these. 3.4873269249167764
not these two or three years perhaps. 3.7608797616770286
his brother inlaw , Mr hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend Mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year. 3.4416601779421736
Mrs bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing. 3.319358834793132
"come , darcy , " said he , "i must have you dance. 3.9599013323550123
but i confess they would have no charms for me. 3.386310888683997
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence , strict liability , breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph Number. 3.5004866020717174
" "you are then resolved to have him ? " "i have said no such thing. 3.271600027383121
he comes down on thursday at the latest , very likely on wednesday. 4.356508589855933
it is Mr wickham 's intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. 3.4553371730802347
was not a man to be trusted. 4.7669668556768094
"i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself. 3.2173373898991393
" elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr wickham 's attentions. 3.7139221927677744
miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth. 3.0003837429274967
"indeed , Mr bennet , " said she , "it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! " "my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. 3.5132906170687206
you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us. 3.4997920976043604
but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her. 5.022367395948733
well , he certainly is very agreeable , and i give you leave to like him. 3.9029382861174278
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. 3.694198757472111
his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. 3.2307290289166395
in spite of having been at st. 3.4082968306040775
till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. 4.089324340673899
your ladyship wants Mr darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ? supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged. 3.3791929545326624
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life. 3.81769388108478
they will never be distressed for money. 3.3694689282369645
"what will be his surprise , " thought she , "when he knows who they are ! he takes them now for people of fashion. 3.18421660080578
it was lady catherine de bourgh. 3.170957026477371
" elizabeth did not know what to make of it. 3.2484500620029144
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene. 3.5348253655127424
" "this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , " said he. 3.103077154252056
seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman 's concurrence. 3.611510223756241
" and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case. 4.643819843704649
painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled. 4.099487780177969
does she live near you , sir ? " "the garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from rosings park , her ladyship 's residence. 3.3446550969745186

they are all for what they can get. 3.6524664217089464
of the lady 's sensations they remained a little in doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough. 3.198606721098043
"oh ! my dear Mr bennet , " as she entered the room , "we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball. 3.3956131682353585
had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal. 3.5691264355483123
my aunt told me so herself on saturday. 3.311028863791993
Mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking , mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together. 3.4070005782579305
she blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour. 3.5352757603700393

Mr bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase. 3.832572496097736
Mr collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance. 3.903144408546807
; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them. 3.7080174588963857
they found Mr bennet still up. 3.416113193975943
"he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? if he fears me , why come hither ? if he no longer cares for me , why silent ? teazing , teazing , man ! i will think no more about him. 3.3723392836949277
she felt that jane 's feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility. 3.582904154129428
" "i did not know before , " continued bingley immediately , "that you were a studier of character. 3.5393146924365855
my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made. 3.8982885744738534
" "when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other. 3.475078820297282
how shall we punish him for such a speech ? " "nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said elizabeth. 4.254376826949403
" "i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever. 3.185706388557462
" "this is the consequence you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , " said elizabeth. 3.401397405827293
it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world. 2.9652400510043964
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement. 4.304817852577352
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. 4.30286639872444
"gracechurch street , sept. 4.228482587701183
" Mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain. 3.6569262519214023
i am sick of them all. 3.5852523276843273
you are to understand , miss bennet , that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will i be dissuaded from it. 3.59781426325742
" "but you how are you ? " cried elizabeth. 2.936224924049006
" Mr gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. 3.0944154764238743
as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on. 3.5114247022218326
" "you need not distress yourself. 3.248411896800924
" and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together. 3.491025850699621
his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go. 3.7764816057152037
elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down stairs from her mother 's apartment , immediately met her. 3.498795438329427
" "if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there. 3.3594115532371744
"let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; "it will then be early enough for expectation. 4.101692349306918
" "and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley. 3.9534633346474184
they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , Mr and Mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind. 3.9308698311829433
she could think only of her letter. 3.226985624881485
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer Mr bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st. 3.1866833548664713
on both sides it was only assertion. 3.995545726355532
vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously. 3.5812016821581736
it adds even another motive. 3.6673260388320705
you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice. 3.6231211179498124
"but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , " replied her uncle. 4.687690712217517
" "you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which i have never acknowledged. 3.4106112698160747
Mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father 's active superintendance , and when immediately before my father 's death , Mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself. 3.905403562495467
but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you. 3.476769790582393
but she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies. 2.9673157422212735
darcy , after enquiring of her how Mr and Mrs gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing. 3.479947927198157
" "a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe. 2.9855765609925315
he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us. 4.070602852527431

other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose fordyce 's sermons. 3.4486935103150107
"and is this all ? " cried elizabeth. 3.535138575828843
no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation. 3.6690411432596766
how much you must have gone through ! " her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr and Mrs gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party. 4.021573799045985
Mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr bingley. 3.4831592767139834
i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly. 3.382725840276774
" the wedding took place ; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual. 3.752561096629115
but when they see , as i trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other. 3.4566538996014855
it was not known that wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living. 3.382402300329881
" darcy smiled and said , "you are perfectly right. 3.416030458030069
they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression. 3.174035388567663
other schemes too came into her head. 3.429794119259785
when the party broke up , lydia returned with Mrs forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning. 3.489074453969205
it was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her ; and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. 3.8393438919326943

she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. 3.859379196283189
no principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with Mr darcy. 3.6664793656101775
" "good gracious ! Mr darcy ! and so it does i vow. 3.4905467443565446
Mr bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister 's , Mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man. 3.895779112691456
"you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty. 3.690253584888759
when Mr collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by charlotte 's evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten. 3.6683235140816297
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. 3.1169019829620668
he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty. 4.287476359757971
a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme. 3.826894710345257
" Mrs reynolds 's respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master. 3.620954534850376

" "that is the most unforgiving speech , " said elizabeth , "that i ever heard you utter. 3.6128388264583897
as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " Mr bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day ? " "i advise Mr darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , " said Mrs bennet , "to walk to oakham mount this morning. 4.068172317183554
" "have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ? but now it comes out. 3.330811965852064
the hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object. 3.75978820212871
as a clergyman , moreover , i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. 3.262300935498187
"where is your sister ? " said he hastily , as he opened the door. 4.180880007634323
too much , i am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for i ought not to have mentioned the subject ? this will never do. 3.544857212899025
in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self reproach. 3.748892906516668
"he must be an oddity , i think , " said she. 4.847266087455558
their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham 's extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them. 3.8767934115986202
" "were it certain that lady catherine would think so , " said Mr collins very gravely "but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you. 3.5961933328211817
elizabeth was now to see Mr wickham for the last time. 3.728942753144387
you and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr bingley might like you the best of the party. 3.56024468043423
as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth. 3.6227903363517187
he has children of his own , and may have more. 3.7674278647041293

colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body. 3.6052850818661586
the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of kitty. 4.08669831587354
" elizabeth longed to observe that Mr bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself. 4.039285990521656
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter. 3.320330968559376
my reasons for believing it are briefly these : it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable. 2.9938505182967483
i will have no reserves from you. 3.6523735719084813
it has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor. 3.6562048756513
Mr darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. 3.58047028061245
as soon as jane had read Mr gardiner 's hope of lydia 's being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance. 3.620306034379322
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent. 2.704011964853925
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so. 4.583626182357643
"in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was. 4.224672078485725

through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance. 4.043352606128513
elizabeth 's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. 3.2852990567340163
we have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve. 3.5526764781688667
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder. 3.7365904654549675
" "and my mother how is she ? how are you all ? " "my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken. 3.205889105000068

they are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines. 3.8813589437423537

" "oh ! if that is all , i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better. 3.4463516118245723
she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses. 3.864305841537879
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Mr collins , in describing the civility of Mr and Mrs philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house. 3.628860749690509
my aunt 's intelligence had given me hope , and i was determined at once to know every thing. 3.8195385125700265

his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit. 3.667913706810332
Mrs bennet 's eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , "well , jane , who is it from ? what is it about ? what does he say ? well , jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love. 3.4950203082997673

Mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away. 3.4596219171393234
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. 3.5201215567155413
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from lady catherine. 3.599172947573805
my temper i dare not vouch for. 3.3449298235043963

she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter 's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place. 3.6604678602489957
" "but he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather 's death made her mistress of this fortune. 3.201337352079991
" "i dare say you believed it ; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. 3.801975061369894
" "no , " said her father , "wickham 's a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. 3.902062908274682
and so , my dear sister , i find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley. 3.5596813388784088
" "if your master would marry , you might see more of him. 3.1154087748935377
sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance. 3.6874023360030956
" "may we take my uncle 's letter to read to her ? " "take whatever you like , and get away. 3.561147441814202
Mr gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase. 3.573201162726311
it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane 's attractions. 3.8596986483928166
" "all this she must possess , " added darcy , "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading. 3.5897956927302705

" Mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer. 3.6945241094955747

- "oh ! Mr collins ! " - "my dear madam , " replied he , "let us be for ever silent on this point. 3.5438629760845246
in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ? all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry. 3.8296974953595764

they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered. 3.7092075327826715
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot. 3.3237668983970097

in such an exigence my uncle 's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his goodness. 3.846717800290975
well , how pleased i am ! and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now. 3.6134725881848775
Mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. 3.5724969442692913
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park. 3.4225010626840655
" "you have a house in town , i conclude ? " Mr darcy bowed. 3.3537525102308288
i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town. 3.4309789604589187

with no greater events than these in the longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did january and february pass away. 3.2373271763648837
she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers. 3.7400468770453017
" darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject. 2.8904729481525266

if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. 3.6293649974664874
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on ; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. 3.300638096933373
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn. 3.0340812942111164
your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance. 3.6606774931822383
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given. 3.054538653596049
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. 3.4088886349755807

Mr wickham 's chief object was unquestionably my sister 's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement. 3.991801807066771
he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. 3.814606070969946
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. 3.584138212992996
Mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them. 3.6806742045402716

for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter. 3.2673401070959347
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? " elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning. 3.9099295157589014
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther. 3.947212878926104

her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty. 3.4282517191825503
her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it. 4.89797565134617
Mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , &c. 3.6509946915209603
and so , is it quite certain he is coming ? " "you may depend on it , " replied the other , "for Mrs nicholls was in meryton last night ; i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true. 3.749740194620906

it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy. 3.8130727230846464
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth ; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , "i saw you look at me to day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and i know i appeared distressed. 3.6278425653018496

he heard her attentively , and then said , "lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances. 3.9627345548281885
Mr wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry. 3.1509004315698337
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity. 3.9040858532997333
" "that is not an unnatural surmise , " said fitzwilliam , "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin 's triumph very sadly. 4.278784645636415
she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night. 3.6718761549468986
"good heaven ! what is to become of us ! what are we to do ! " would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. 3.3297044424834183
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley 's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady 's side , the acquaintance would now be renewed. 3.7834718867527086
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for Mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , lord - and to the great surprise of all the party , when Mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him. 3.864573025942017
"i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town. 3.9152514725741514
more thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed. 3.9208163650783656
" this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away. 3.743639706994648
jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw Mr darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister. 3.828457358081433

he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia 's flight , on her own folly alone. 3.459226201777662

a lady 's imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment. 3.2275166781191365
how wonderfully these sort of things occur ! who would have thought of my meeting with perhapsa nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly ! i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. 3.17067037535793
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. 3.337110945822427
accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer. 3.6427910986773466
and what claims has lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge ; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. 3.577575431823204
had the late Mr darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father 's uncommon attachment to me , irritated him i believe very early in life. 3.5465679219161226
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled. 3.8405470673106388
i saw them the night before last. 3.72762294895098
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself. 3.422933612000114
upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. 3.4633905470313793
this letter is from Mr collins. 4.147121898791308
"i know not , miss elizabeth , " said he , "whether Mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it. 3.626569606738553
she is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. 3.5298139673822613

such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them. 3.6874979615280856
in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels. 3.0788848560902524
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets ; and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure. 3.6819471358901334
she certainly did not hate him. 3.43359654492557

the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , "are you pleased with kent ? " a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk. 3.6038899885247346
it was then disclosed in the following manner. 4.229135085258033
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could. 3.4926016965721187
they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either. 3.793584512319084
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. 3.434805941434356
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. 3.4703272482526364
on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. 3.735064124931826

seriously , i would have you be on your guard. 3.689965394107542
for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey. 3.441065810225012
" "as often as i can. 3.756207461941223
what say you , mary ? for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know , and read great books , and make extracts. 3.7257082431115167
jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , "oh , papa , what news ? what news ? have you heard from my uncle ? " "yes , i have had a letter from him by express. 3.8774386902227307

she looked at jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns. 3.063844390812327
darcy took up a book ; miss bingley did the same ; and Mrs hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother 's conversation with miss bennet. 3.684951069911433

but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due. 3.7083118798328107
however , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and i am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves. 3.5495292619717165
at any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life. 3.692363940231568
at such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable. 3.8312735967606066
if she does not object to it , why should we ? " " her not objecting , does not justify him. 3.454790284040638
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs hurst and miss bingley ; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. 3.626514811084914
four weeks passed away , and jane saw nothing of him. 3.708986566221512
for forty years , he produced and distributed project gutenberg tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. 4.011111873233432
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , "i have never had a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old. 3.5946497273352818
there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard. 4.2241832029202735
her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others. 3.5297774013217116
you know my sentiments. 3.5237081796708405
his sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london. 3.2820877447745813
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her. 3.660335205454168
perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me. 3.734542066193182
he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy. 3.64934811141331
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination. 3.9205836945749803
by tea time however the dose had been enough , and Mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. 3.864154508080042
she was not rendered formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self importance , and brought Mr wickham immediately to elizabeth 's mind ; and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented. 3.3304104997257733
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. 4.024790036279773
it is impossible that he should still love me. 3.2684649833748125
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved. 3.551541159455685
" but Mr gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters. 4.014533096464535
but , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother 's. 3.6826383494689594
it is very unlucky ; but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now. 3.5431672370808402
when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. 3.549539722103257
" elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. 3.24885265465974
i wish i could see her. 3.2786255430631734
did you see it ? " bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations. 4.010287035641888
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman. 3.5962328563482777
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline 's interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one. 3.9528752639868943
Mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk. 3.228422455975377
" "i am exceedingly gratified , " said bingley , "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. 3.152123586913268
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; i wish i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that i despair. 4.195219521603961
if , as i conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. 3.547227911928814
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia 's situation , hastily exclaimed , "i beg your pardon , but i must leave you. 3.8536481263495985
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl. 3.2031769208774623
elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father 's behaviour as a husband. 3.7707442347035696
every thing being settled between them , Mr darcy 's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home. 3.9032908579788748
Mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. 3.5812661235308116
"i knew , " said he , "that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary. 3.844273690258963

how could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister 's attachment ; and she could not help remembering what charlotte 's opinion had always been. 4.064464382070691

" "i had not thought Mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him , i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this ! " after a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , "i do remember his boasting one day , at netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper. 3.986213642477029
you alluded to something else. 3.326721229468935

elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph. 3.5381312278107444
when you told Mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? " "nay , " cried bingley , "this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. 3.7567857434524004
i promised them so faithfully ! what will wickham say ? it was to be such a secret ! " "if it was to be secret , " said jane , "say not another word on the subject. 3.9319757496620293
" miss bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room. 2.985609250127894
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on. 4.441114375082417

her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine 's curiosity. 3.4160822083232394

her mother 's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much. 3.3981641498473696

he was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother inlaw , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could. 3.7558244239317617

but when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. 3.545426141480591

her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself. 3.0702042239597707
" "you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ; and indeed i am quite of your opinion. 3.3438083410639656
could she have seen half as much love in Mr darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes. 3.6245012045672196
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. 3.085686077817294
"oh ! yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! she plays and sings all day long. 3.583686875440165
e. 2.515032492749843
i should infinitely prefer a book. 3.1546739577261564
i shall now know how to act. 3.609386308674678
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not. 3.628135736290349
i was only confused for the moment , because i felt that i should be looked at. 3.751768400772051
" "i certainly shall not. 3.1412096325784504
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. 3.044485907924951
but think no more of the letter. 4.355459020216641
but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded. 3.6722170166541512
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay. 4.049650799611342
she went on. 4.445165752830366
i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong. 3.273299511724563
chapter viii. 2.2111971152442003
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs bennet and the children. 4.0983469333468605
i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read. 4.224963633692364
she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , "when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance. 3.50356467928607
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. 3.666892509393151
it was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of miss bennet 's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever. 3.5476098627238186
only look at her. 3.6577142169325647
but you are always giving her the preference. 3.600681923202734
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. 3.728906178547898
" "perhaps i do. 3.4137806072820336
Mr bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene. 3.4037622400778265
much as i respect them , i believe , i thought only of you. 4.2651904911053595
but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it. 3.1352833854189743
" "neglect ! i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. 3.1207558077447732
" "had you then persuaded yourself that i should ? " "indeed i had. 3.3995048638397503
' those were your words. 3.579774769704116
" "already arisen ! " repeated Mr bennet. 3.4592345886535223
they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs gardiner thought of him , and Mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece 's beginning the subject. 4.626024875669577
my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. 3.468954755653373
i have a high respect for your nerves. 3.2534794142221055
those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as Mrs forster called her , and they were going to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public. 3.8446330713275554
" "that would be a good scheme , " said elizabeth , "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home. 3.7097651093859834
" "let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility. 3.3861281954508375
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but Mrs bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , "you are very kind , sir , i am sure ; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough. 4.103691848153422
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it. 3.9730888312771495
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. 4.757993117700684
Mrs bennet could hardly contain herself. 2.785228116654291
she enquired after his sister , but could do no more. 3.8677171274480373
Mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both. 3.128596337624378
"fitzwilliam darcy. 4.215159227059373
oh ! why is not every body as happy ? " elizabeth 's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express. 3.6204969945375938
" "very true , indeed ; and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody. 3.2853850141253305
there was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies. 3.316009782927223
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia 's leaving home. 3.331269984136752
mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance. 4.035892244833272
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion. 4.084155827393885
" "oh ! certainly , " said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; "we will ask you no questions. 3.0123000430269666
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished. 3.9268650942078516
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology. 3.3826930027477085
on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married. 3.4117436808787778
" "and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ? " "how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ! i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister 's happiness with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. 3.543829452033798
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. 3.1115108239481057
e. 2.515032492749843
" "and can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? " "i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. 3.210691734683298
his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it. 4.006149701192608
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together. 3.4090625503212917
colonel forster will , i dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head. 3.4110444715466435
" elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. 3.0875541480620803
do you often dance at st. 3.1144296100002022
he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself. 3.6256648898377124
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother 's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr darcy , who sat opposite to them. 3.6279178243058863
- "you dislike an argument , and want to silence this. 3.243161177926116
chapter xiv. 2.857179731996027
he bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr darcy , with an expression of half laughing alarm. 3.81779822940286
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door. 3.5361648390083613
Mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many. 3.2613912089641275
let me advise you then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence. 3.443038528468708
having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy. 3.899128449661096
we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way. 3.9316977217555125
but that is not the case here. 4.199074646520481
you both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage. 4.143224735885102
if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer. 4.286689252966856
chapter xvi. 2.857179731996027
" "how can you contrive to write so even ? " he was silent. 3.0217802226869774
their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. 3.911802443208012
without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want. 3.5488987381206045
with them he is remarkably agreeable. 3.631705867501867
she had very little notice from any but him. 3.070830993596331
i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy. 4.325143163340452
" "pardon me for interrupting you , madam , " cried Mr collins ; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. 3.444109337064959
" in darcy 's presence she dared not mention wickham 's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment 's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. 4.3049458579150945
he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others. 4.022677040975393
" "and what did she say ? " "that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well. 3.450333220167746
" but elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , "no , no ; stay where you are. 3.5412387976178517
elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course. 3.0748151675766917
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for Mr collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton. 3.5919182180353206
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , i am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before. 3.693586007371716
" how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! her aunt now called her to look at a picture. 3.2222550659295806
" "a little sea bathing would set me up for ever. 2.9438202912924667
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. 3.818182301934116
at length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready. 4.054924801349394
she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley. 3.464729594015299
you refuse , then , to oblige me. 3.617147594742172
" "but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about. 3.4027419248638
lady catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer 's countenance. 3.449712357372265
" "as i did the other day , " said elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; "very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that. 3.5380119471884055
Mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party. 3.09598324501812
" "for heaven 's sake , madam , speak lower. 3.661108023378824
" "he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied elizabeth with emphasis , "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life. 3.6113905302371907
these two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber. 3.0393259602533687
i have faults enough , but they are not , i hope , of understanding. 3.3951330572946405
" their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford , they reached Mr gardiner 's house , where they were to remain a few days. 3.6489799547474773
to the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others. 3.737819990039231
"your cousin 's conduct does not suit my feelings. 3.2774010748125972
but nothing can be done ; i know very well that nothing can be done. 3.182073711659499
she had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. 3.246881752045407
they were hopeless of remedy. 3.326330014939224
she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it. 3.7463838189464473
she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. 3.370856452673338
chapter v. 3.0991478320975108
they all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses. 4.37178499155477
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master ; she comes here to morrow with him. 3.080796040265336
you cannot have been always at longbourn. 3.5001372502419144
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. 3.299117382388372
you must contrive to send somebody. 3.1697830250724137
Mr collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed. 3.181258457149722
thus , we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. 3.3713319430298347
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did. 3.3188825520569094
"it was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , "which was my chief inducement to enter the shire. 3.451908177562381
i hope there was. 3.5661516975532157
"we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said Mrs gardiner , "but perhaps to the lakes. 3.7565633732663124
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. 3.209073541210496
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted. 3.239483181322325
his father , miss bennet , the late Mr darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had ; and i can never be in company with this Mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. 4.330900660012669
he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected. 3.6359334545645945
"i am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs bennet , "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. 3.4120854443775674
and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , what could it mean ? that he should even speak to her was amazing ! but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. 3.3817987792924735
by this time she is actually with them ! if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! " "we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said jane : "i hope and trust they will yet be happy. 3.3798683094909943
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked. 4.411931287527701
it was in the times and the courier , i know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be. 4.665374515397316
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight. 2.970778481657013
you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people. 3.842673526417571
f. 2.7829467218352515
i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. 3.2449278972276123
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished. 3.6757945144702604
he shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish. 4.386988248966679
that Mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as Mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings. 3.9739841275402386
next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then. 3.3941636895520935
excuse me for i must speak plainly. 4.240616433285195
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce. 3.518490364300007
your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with. 4.002570466400588
" elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to colonel fitzwilliam , "your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word i say. 3.7026996651758566
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose. 3.8851018854710504
" "my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally i assure you. 3.501269188579302
indeed he has no improper pride. 4.124529117815465
it would be dreadful ! she blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk. 3.468093325429945
" "no , nothing at all. 2.7516307278220613
Mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state. 3.740087590386265
why does she not come in ? " "oh ! charlotte says , she hardly ever does. 3.646313925363659
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday. 3.5907784716657987
he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her. 2.9391455612123547
they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself. 4.236024448988546
it was the last of the regiment 's stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. 3.601374816506834
but now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in lydia 's marriage. 3.5171343244948203
"indeed , you are mistaken , madam. 3.7934165378874094
if you love Mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy. 3.656682248849913
you know i always speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. 3.5277423779426904
you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me. 3.369689256977825
they were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain. 3.3629300279915553
" "i can easily believe it. 3.0647072695684505
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. 3.933059329160892
"i must ask whether you were surprised ? " said elizabeth. 3.3192078471456425
" "yes ; but he seemed to like his second better. 3.414446759753324
" the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret. 3.585421908631795
"not yet , " replied jane. 4.791852452710614
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected. 3.2064968302103387
" elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. 2.8886894376304104
elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight. 3.1994335022294154
after this day , jane said no more of her indifference. 3.628130316664548
she was at least free from the offence of Mr darcy 's farther notice ; though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak. 3.4010594511605676
i only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it. 3.5035924153024784
there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again. 3.550269830473837
jane was not happy. 3.11579589743125
but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton , these visitors came. 3.1725571714607224
what could be more natural than his asking you again ? he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. 3.260897640774561
but these are not jane 's feelings ; she is not acting by design. 3.548138137127023
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other. 3.6735687105597887
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. 4.042072032239858
her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her. 4.013424368427933
" "if i were as rich as Mr darcy , " cried a young lucas who came with his sisters , "i should not care how proud i was. 3.5431356104426186
"can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated. 4.162525114752306
they were not the only objects of Mr collins 's admiration. 3.557227123114831
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way. 3.758558467318013
but before they heard again from Mr gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from Mr collins ; which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read ; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise. 3.6918163750505912
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire. 3.4551127753908855
" "are they indeed ? " cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction. 3.7117670872693878
these are conditions , which , considering every thing , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you. 4.034396831299194
"i know very well , madam , " said he , "that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. 3.270961822235299
" "ten thousand pounds ! heaven forbid ! how is half such a sum to be repaid ? " Mr bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house. 3.1502548509153923
Mr darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them. 3.8380548670054098
will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? " and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight. 4.034388031757745
" "very true , my dear , that is exactly what i say. 3.3179572871212537
" "lady catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added charlotte , "and a most attentive neighbour. 3.3252486695929817
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister 's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. 3.300769712505606
but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good. 3.615386043452316
chapter xii. 2.2111971152442003
&c. 5.115219043740827
many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man. 3.6315556200311807
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable. 4.15018458167013
her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome. 4.012685739092027
he studies too much for words of four syllables. 3.4744521096893353
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of Mr darcy , she could not but allow that Mr bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits. 4.152339070327859
they will have nothing else to do. 3.5249162067351576
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects. 2.694352950081101
" " that you certainly shall. 3.1706719887678205
the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you. 3.1515541431447165
" "your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you. 3.394507236662817
i was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Mr darcy. 3.6101203168352747
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far. 3.4374905362630095
he was full of joy and attention. 3.15182520243532
" Mr and Mrs gardiner smiled. 3.696572995518371
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. 3.0082012617509886
"i am sure , " said she , "i cried for two days together when colonel millar 's regiment went away. 2.669689149746242
" "you are uniformly charming ! " cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; "and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable. 3.1620401322231713
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenelworth , birmingham , &c. 3.46304481098509
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. 3.3377733470080226
Number. 2.239615789728809
and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ? poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me. 3.9444131102076407
she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy 's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another. 3.5317819886233397
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. 3.6851987116952323
no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called. 3.8515805353048123
he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend. 4.678337628658751
she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung. 3.7686578952269625
he took the hint , and soon began with , "this seems a very comfortable house. 2.8829541589537886
i shall see her in january. 3.5559483806536076
" elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit. 3.3884406420734456
we acted with the best intentions. 3.566341158907746
the part which i acted , is now to be explained. 3.674717635503959
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr darcy. 3.9549593992019703
the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of Mrs forster , the delight of Mrs bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described. 3.980705337207008
Mrs reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father 's life time. 3.9862846895983455
" "after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. 3.3835390766408997
elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled. 3.4065230721520585
" "which do you mean ? " and turning round , he looked for a moment at elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , "she is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt me ; and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. 3.5013635897549764
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia. 4.2685268758389
after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display. 3.4180990190340754
"indeed , jane , you ought to believe me. 4.155954675062291
vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled ! oh ! my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? " Mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , "do not make yourself uneasy , my love. 3.7104476241515063
" "mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure , but i did not think it right for either of them. 3.445002471376295
as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables. 3.456594090041312
Mrs collins , did i tell you of lady metcalfe 's calling yesterday to thank me ? she finds miss pope a treasure. 3.3437181237111604
they came. 4.323298066591605
but i am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! they were excessively sorry to go ! but so they always are. 3.283553652248383
"lizzy , " said he , "i was going to look for you ; come into my room. 3.2601027937263933
"and they are really to be married ! " cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves. 3.859018636000621
miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before. 3.3606542480838817
there could not exist in the world two men , over whom Mr darcy could have such boundless influence. 4.105181407678372
indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not. 4.107046352417819
" * * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and Mrs bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour 's visit , had revived. 3.407089741123439
"it certainly is a most iniquitous affair , " said Mr bennet , "and nothing can clear Mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn. 3.594603614391037
Mrs collins knew not what to make of him. 3.2508891599617145
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! " "oh ! jane , " cried elizabeth , "was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? " "i do not know. 3.770688649946539
Number. 2.239615789728809
" "but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out. 3.2727285240596014
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; i can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side. 3.6647411863780666
" chapter xxi. 2.4110914932864635
"oh ! mary , " said she , "i wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along , kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too. 3.97914131382514
Mr bingley 's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before. 3.7571662802062096
" the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. 3.1177652801190643
" "yes , very well. 2.828251975177769
" "miss bennet i am shocked and astonished. 2.840853959820745
it needed all jane 's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity. 3.028910363864226
to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men. 4.088994840028423
e. 2.515032492749843
" "though it is difficult , " said jane , "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit. 3.375035160670867
neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Mr darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach. 3.4279904817647084
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend. 3.7041633698070426
"it would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. 3.7799305880888165
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley 's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. 3.815688690201748
it is too long ago. 3.4214350975358907
it was at sir william lucas 's , where a large party were assembled. 3.4483947006940463
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour 's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment. 3.2806483709161136
" elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more. 3.350626386725988
but she is nothing to me now. 3.4841376604588046
"i am all astonishment. 3.3662120089932213
i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy. 3.4476155414755003
- i talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples. 4.264102666109876
" "there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. 3.6935592120953817
" "another time , lizzy , " said her mother , "i would not dance with him , if i were you. 3.7119810192225002
jane was by no means better. 3.584052515053229
haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week. 5.066200296101888
in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before. 3.571844896281125
she dared not relate the other half of Mr darcy 's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. 3.5721953772657393
" "i dislike it very much , " he replied ; "but it must be done. 3.56907505139254
your sister i also watched. 3.68727509573931
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do. 3.7335287201337857
i am impatient to see him. 3.3741568036312493
but my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it to morrow. 3.826232136079253
he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. 3.5800418250970347
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard. 3.4921134440784547
"excuse my interference. 4.037008215815757
" "do you suppose them to be in london ? " "yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? " "and lydia used to want to go to london , " added kitty. 3.2555531952035883
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information. 3.9166321705571727
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room ; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. 4.258420978017891
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. 3.317513400689246
miss bennet 's lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice. 4.04019244327008
Number. 2.239615789728809
" Mrs bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of bingley 's behaviour to jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals. 4.017195572358338
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr bingley and netherfield. 3.840878002848245
"having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority. 3.389107269020082
" "if we thought alike of miss bingley , " replied jane , "your representation of all this , might make me quite easy. 3.664205365116202
i never saw such a long chin in my life. 3.1734344288160075
elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , "you mean to frighten me , Mr darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. 3.7835603287462285
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street. 3.536337642555119
" Mr darcy smiled ; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh. 3.7348478247423005
he does not want abilities. 4.165410910879314
lady catherine , sir william , and Mr and Mrs collins sat down to quadrille ; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs jenkinson to make up her party. 3.9323950977765736

" Mrs hill began instantly to express her joy. 3.2514579096534355
" this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas. 2.884580598426413
"oh ! my dear father , " she cried , "come back , and write immediately. 3.072326105011291
she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked. 4.827385315922292
he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask. 3.7240001685777715
"my dearest lizzy will , i am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley 's regard for me. 3.78843672724019
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment. 3.2805599527798073
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. 3.7684333246338637
on the following monday , Mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn. 3.8102704871710498
when tea was over , Mr hurst reminded his sister inlaw of the card tablebut in vain. 3.340181705048117
as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner. 4.090672013566059
" "yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever. 3.887058448076623
"what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment. 3.9224821273969503
the first week of their return was soon gone. 3.244464731265137
but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. 3.15089942949726
all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road. 3.608278267617492
" miss bennet still looked all amazement. 3.0436745807198258
but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant. 4.084751481157793
" "i should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , "if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. 3.5822800548720815
" "it is not Mr bingley , " said her husband ; "it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life. 3.661820865887808
" "i never thought Mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do. 3.0112726410989645
Mr darcy 's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister 's sufferings. 3.893450405270027
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends. 3.7126852810700894
after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquire if Mr wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball. 3.5991711062441576
her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it. 3.28619177928645
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr darcy 's proposals. 3.675001978058638
when they ascended the steps to the hall , maria 's alarm was every moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly calm. 3.2397475440577774

but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister 's feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished. 3.7558962225630927

Mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , "my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. 3.4904861201764636

miss bennet accepted her aunt 's invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline 's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him. 3.829568015866717

charlotte the wife of Mr collins , was a most humiliating picture ! and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen. 3.8678186275315265
" "and that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london ! my dear aunt , how could you think of it ?

we are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is. 3.9356671043863707

there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth 's mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance. 3.3288430686951074

it was a rational scheme to be sure ! but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea. 3.540284399180611

" when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. 3.629595226008712
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr darcy 's pleasure in the bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , "i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here. 3.6649982172971747

she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. 4.063397496785494

lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley 's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone. 3.405461584091596

without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment. 4.337689808369241
but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. 3.6275164907791226
" but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley 's being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. 3.671119573839229

Mr collins then returned to elizabeth. 3.3576490748588594
on distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities. 3.6245204521275487
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him. 3.4440498227364844
" "this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west. 3.538072100841898
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with lydia , to send any message to her. 3.6748940640163315
she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but i will make her know it. 3.576647130762651
" wickham 's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , "you , who so well know my feelings towards Mr darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right. 3.725869328328613
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. 3.1124676224788157
james 's ? " "never , sir. 4.19519443007045
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. 3.8435252939115188
" he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said. 3.3358741529517464
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. 3.9928794071233917
bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable. 3.5501941207361924
" "no more have i , " said Mr bennet ; "and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you. 3.690613550042537
lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me jane 's beauty. 3.910984021955862
" " Mr darcy , you see , is the man ! now , lizzy , i think i have surprised you. 3.9227828274777314
"what could become of Mr bingley and jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs. 3.393063186853341
"for we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , "in a great measure , to his kindness. 3.4785669805609887
chapter ix. 2.2111971152442003
its completion depended on others. 3.6263032709276795
"i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle. 4.098882445394062
we now come to the point. 3.6453140782727202
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. 3.1020736718951487
she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself. 3.957595750814579
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side. 3.757650751512161
allowing for the common demands of the game , Mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr darcy. 4.067685412829248
" she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley. 3.74792188020158
an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with wickham ! imagine our surprise. 3.3373913711404177
the foundation 's ein or federal tax identification number is Number Number. 3.178668660813549
pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it. 3.7808271430582825
he was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane 's letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no fresh pain. 3.7772974677120983
" "certainly , " replied elizabeth "there are such people , but i hope i am not one of them. 3.740313425330327
"what could he mean ? she was dying to know what could be his meaning " and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? "not at all , " was her answer ; "but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it. 3.0441919333284826
chapter xi. 2.857179731996027
it will save me a world of trouble and economy. 3.1351718626170277
"no ; but it must be done soon. 4.672754827491391
" elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together. 3.6010673181400192
" "i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ; but i always speak what i think. 3.6737687536884636
" "no i cannot talk of books in a ball room ; my head is always full of something else. 2.984746899671348
" elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them. 3.3003605686120947
" "i beg you would not put it into lizzy 's head to be vexed by his ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. 3.281660364975804
" "such as vanity and pride. 2.922151187070497
if Mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ? " "because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it. 3.117706311028766
" not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did Mrs bennet give up the point. 3.870804554790687
"your affectionate friend , "lydia bennet. 3.668320161280594
"eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds. 3.948534896586271
i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older. 3.49044556392881
" "thank you but i always mend my own. 3.3233000895178306
you wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if i speak ill of any body. 3.6085612134593616
i will only add , god bless you. 2.9129926774128285
in comparing her recollection of pemberley , with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself. 3.8583498880854297
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. 3.3160015365358837
" this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities. 3.711463957814591
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. 4.356853716664314
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. 3.1556162284583773
her keenest attention was awakened ; she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , "there are very few people of whom so much can be said. 3.958790761740078
hope was over , entirely over ; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort. 3.868683918413096
our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to you shall try it some day. 3.091756013808774
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united states. 2.6591122639895626
in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. 3.5511683816633783
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere. 3.31700075109057
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn. 3.311349670406148
" "you persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him. 3.1267494381635053
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin 's corroboration. 3.700725397800295
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned. 3.59218335033744
again she read on. 4.42657127769274
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. 3.4445467898332724
we must not all expect jane 's good fortune. 3.198153684297343
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother 's admiration. 3.658912627601105
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. 4.127999314054811
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner. 3.6672692654074113
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom. 3.8038754843614053
it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. 3.3454057139288382
is this to be endured ! but it must not , shall not be. 4.06795910687897
the officers may not be so pleasant in general - 's regiment. 3.4084108604853425
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr darcy had been staying there. 3.435454655188377
after tea , Mr bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument. 4.534808478235117
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it. 3.5683278452604417
i now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him. 4.220302882439906
they were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of pemberley might be something ! they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned. 3.5469094475726477
she had gained her point , and had time to consider of it. 3.697496952449015
i know how much you dislike him. 3.4878978498817834
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london. 3.356003148517233
Mr collins must excuse me. 3.3002026957804005
but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company. 3.4723644995005833
) "well , so much the better. 3.2485892344032443
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Mr collins joining in , observed , "yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will be delighted with her. 3.666347518248339
i understand that Mr collins has made you an offer of marriage. 3.3477173120727546
your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land. 4.326313534233096
" "undoubtedly. 2.981361543076423
elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother 's thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away. 3.176198925831037
they repulsed every attempt of Mrs bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr collins , who was complimenting Mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. 3.7261000629517786
i am perfectly serious in my refusal. 3.146697044093637
" he listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long. 3.433981874483789
i do not believe she often sees such at home. 3.005648260461341
federal laws and your state 's laws. 3.353723166142671
my sister , i am sure , will not hear of her removal. 3.924434264508766
they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry. 3.3244158412458362
i need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable. 3.6255587336401427
" and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr collins thus addressed her , "when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character. 3.5531362031231923
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. 3.3503179226208144
"if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield , " said Mrs bennet to her husband , "and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for. 3.679150447627476
" "pride , " observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , "is a very common failing i believe. 3.78971531924551
"aye , there she comes , " continued Mrs bennet , "looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way. 3.7308021489689738
with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand. 3.584411496655171
darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence. 3.6999857145809933
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world. 3.420776423809565
easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important. 3.848285970159744
let me mend it for you. 3.2400016490442702
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? " "what think you of this sentence , my dear lizzy ? " said jane as she finished it. 3.494276223466559
"oh ! yes i understand you perfectly. 3.1643862637270024
" "ah ! " cried Mrs bennet , shaking her head , "then she is better off than many girls. 3.3888843572012393
our situation with regard to lady catherine 's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. 3.380738890090979
thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people 's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business. 3.601776866108908
" "what sort of a girl is miss darcy ? " he shook his head. 3.0408260961182703
" "yes , very different. 2.997500605131444
" "you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir. 3.327722241446579
"this is a parade , " cried he , "which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! another day i will do the same ; i will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as i can , or , perhaps , i may defer it , till kitty runs away. 3.7371919323219855
she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found. 4.306878021486763
her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room. 3.697969946646246
they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. 3.7422588300538004
" to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia. 3.3196162094313486
and that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter. 3.5864481295404538
" on miss lucas 's persevering , however , she added , "very well ; if it must be so , it must. 4.221390425894927
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. 3.6118067424157454
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world. 3.7581384406607925
the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances. 3.1245879597598725
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. 3.297123173949276
elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied. 4.104892637194419
" Mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Mr hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. 3.3508779069728813
elizabeth had settled it that Mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. 3.684609854348659
they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to. 3.418188283631639
but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country. 3.2683144270343583
this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. 3.7875260272767974
of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself. 3.2777092635602725
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents. 3.126135737321385
nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world. 3.440108377653021
now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? " "for the liveliness of your mind , i did. 3.3168725760129987
Mrs gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. 4.112668679599745
" "now i have got some news for you , " said lydia , as they sat down to table. 2.960427934664166
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy. 3.4752673940108996
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn. 3.0433755105383438

i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you. 4.260439198007885
i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming. 3.66377988744312
as they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen. 2.9958097315037833
when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , "this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal. 3.766447356607764
he then said , "i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. 3.491542851879267
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her. 4.053549206155597
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you. 3.4837002495862004
i hope she will turn out well. 3.0950259247954457
all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum. 3.343358687560535
when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very unwillingly said so. 3.2297338968168665
his air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal. 4.2668749622516104
he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things. 3.983742696118983
that his two sisters and Mr darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable. 4.312062499825713
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish. 3.830799113293009
" again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. 3.7267557083946703
she dreaded seeing wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. 3.7369816971556635
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more ; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam 's manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind. 3.9306921633617504
a most delightful place ! excellent parsonage house ! it would have suited me in every respect. 3.3280116051634447
she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when. 4.094050523561262
had lydia 's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned. 3.2951310438385764

about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her. 3.229555235350326
" "how can you talk so ? " said jane faintly smiling , - "you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate. 3.4150296614554003
Number. 2.239615789728809
but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet. 3.7751978252088483
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable. 4.15507772498588
Mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary. 3.7148933388247065
" "indeed , " replied elizabeth , "i am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. 3.229601804363885

" and so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house. 3.2419067482589563
my mind was more agreeably engaged. 3.6345109758000813
the younger ones out before the elder are married ! your younger sisters must be very young ? " "yes , my youngest is not sixteen. 3.369502176653507
but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane 's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then. 3.6141586211569927
" miss bingley 's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere. 3.7539407420389206
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance. 3.26407773805799
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing. 3.5968154665656304
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence. 3.4833144034634484
chapter vi. 3.0991478320975108
"if i , " said Mr collins , "were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. 4.26057322694982
" "perhaps , " said darcy , "i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers. 3.4917284906352193
"how despicably have i acted ! " she cried. 3.1266601074270395
once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general charlotte wisely did not hear. 3.9235085755623356
but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable. 3.22716503841615
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton ! i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you. 3.9588051090559295
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. 3.0911984164467396
pardon me. 4.954440755525176
you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters. 3.6845708025743518
but don 't imagine it was from any silly cause. 3.1991675849716303
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day. 3.776164161373587
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced. 3.322331048123713
if he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go. 3.57992904494527
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies. 3.3930969626870016
" "oh ! thoughtless , thoughtless lydia ! " cried elizabeth when she had finished it. 3.7098377910644835
i expected you to stay two months. 3.096688659609541
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr wickham , and rejoiced in it. 3.748903674986673
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged. 3.766105309722243
widely different was the effect of a second perusal. 3.664086132586566
he owns it himself without disguise. 3.4351055944764197
it is what every body says. 3.6101359266921036
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments. 3.196023658268036
"can you come to morrow ? " yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity. 3.6679378484245624
" "i have already told her so once , by your desire. 3.2984646916584417
i pity , though i cannot help blaming her. 3.789405733450997
well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better. 3.4867668378780143
i speak nothing but the truth. 3.7906839831552523
" "she seems a very pleasant young woman , " said bingley. 3.55499661681359
the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. 3.1773644651407973
" 'tis an etiquette i despise , " said he. 3.519218679449034
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one. 3.239161742610112
that such a consequence as this should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts. 3.775850408140088
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way. 3.1744264948387566
" "i should be sorry indeed , if it were. 3.354169650756446
" "no why should he ? if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections , because i had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? " "but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event. 3.7770353545663458

the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. 3.6153234768906284
and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and Mrs long. 3.821932162595848
" "no , no. 2.903304760832803
" "ah ! sir , i do indeed. 3.8281985579618896
" "yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. 3.0563223790165335
elizabeth was determined ; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion. 3.1964072361664244
not like the wild young men now adays , who think of nothing but themselves. 3.77860103495982
yet , indeed , i am in earnest. 5.106908033612345
i know it cannot be long. 3.6026344409611046
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be. 4.138318857156957
since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design. 3.7521322147919984
Mrs bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere. 3.53506230435807
Mr darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. 3.560570195448231

lydia 's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband 's never intending to go there himself. 3.5123756738909178
" on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at pemberley. 3.815442072083477
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits. 3.701796291091139
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness. 3.878505907753792
" "that is very true , " said elizabeth ; "though it had not occurred to me before. 3.344126269736508
i will go directly to Mr bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure. 3.7986984807821695
he is a gentleman ; i am a gentleman 's daughter ; so far we are equal. 3.6230153613372473
Mr collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr darcy 's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way. 3.5353200728509333
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance. 3.4479893706765083
"it has been a very agreeable day , " said miss bennet to elizabeth. 4.318593508527119
the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. 3.473226526646911
every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to charlotte 's first sketch. 4.485829694911955
this was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming. 3.758647651386545
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all. 3.0093103030383355
"he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again. 3.5552197571415136

not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , "jane , i congratulate you. 3.7934232146582243
when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent. 3.644106755634938
but , on second thoughts , perhaps lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person. 3.0516420332158476
wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is. 3.608511605112077
the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr darcy could not have. 3.631723387985814
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. 3.5744475225323353

" this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage. 3.6750156182542706
" "perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her. 3.7520769102932254
jane was not deceived , but she was affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved. 3.788580425078542

it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. 4.092685543123855

jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs. 3.1723817291674337
in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other. 4.394572884835687
Mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last Mr collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility. 3.4166080050102328
" elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing. 3.31587960829766
so imprudent a match on both sides ! but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood. 3.7307149121860608
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word. 3.451673502003724
" they were all astonished ; and Mr bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , "but is there not danger of lady catherine 's disapprobation here , my good sir ? you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness. 3.551214018269384
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment. 3.3993765370715616
such was miss lucas 's scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon. 3.6071377540726552

"from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry. 3.7427398209849647
their table was superlatively stupid. 3.887321626222271
" elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. 3.123137908450268
Mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well. 3.7349533576070084
Mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. 3.1851957407534606
" "i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. 2.860808387368327
" "no , " replied jane , "i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you. 3.803294463091812
on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer. 3.6899555444477947
" "you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. 2.68673801874965

when Mr bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure. 3.7100664410733186

she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known ; she was aware that no one liked him but jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away. 3.404337318811081

had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? " as she pronounced these words , Mr darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued. 3.780549804175362
her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil. 3.8504153006482755

elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty. 4.046070096410499

bingley urged Mr jones 's being sent for immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. 2.931556229502176

the strangeness of Mr collins 's making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. 3.331271296687685
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct. 3.3008573819360136
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs gardiner 's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. 3.9167590922290887

at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward. 3.3984652851688946
what could your ladyship propose by it ? " "at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted. 3.5006283702461634
the business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news. 3.220304271505487
one must speak a little , you know. 4.2581605533506
poor lydia 's situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful. 4.110086651679767
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. 3.1373921717456623
" "is it possible ! " cried elizabeth , when she had finished. 3.5432699290045973
you dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind. 4.261795987983715
" "are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? " " i never saw such a woman. 3.7077137601658428
"by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent. 3.6495393042605855
and do you really love him quite well enough ? oh , lizzy ! do any thing rather than marry without affection. 3.3902471715144213
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party. 4.209394935829318
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband. 5.25349882735574
" she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham. 3.4691933703640605
her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business. 3.527788453271146
" "no " said darcy , "i have made no such pretension. 3.8689252012079693
but no one can throw any blame on them. 3.0356631751126404
"this was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! " said Mrs bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. 3.8799919809925094
" elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Mr darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat. 4.025712620998672
Mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight. 2.897656309240105
while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her. 3.7815274468695628
"if i had been able , " said she , "to carry my point of going to brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her. 3.699193653660387
" "it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said bingley. 3.89562848292044
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley. 3.351514554921364

" "would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " "he made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty. 3.7548759271379315
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained. 3.3369852428659015
elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself. 3.641327526281288
wholly inattentive to her sister 's feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one 's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish. 3.7578098302983904
her father had been an attorney in meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds. 2.8690487854498556
if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable. 4.301436462032532
from what he said of miss darcy , i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl. 3.708254549878833
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia 's general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home. 3.607687267908182
" "that will not do for a compliment to darcy , caroline , " cried her brother "because he does not write with ease. 3.53403507934913
" "you have. 3.1368755270381277
it convinced her , that accident only could discover to Mr bingley her sister 's being in town. 3.549100135887509
" she then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , "come here , my love , i want to speak to you , " took her out of the room. 3.3450230232731997
the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him. 4.0599100394191945
conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none. 4.3182365426801566
" "oh , well ! it is just as he chooses. 3.322786827906283
you do not look well. 3.6473279060302692
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mr bennet coolly observed , "from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. 3.80926335501173
the possibility of Mr collins 's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two ; but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , "engaged to Mr collins ! my dear charlotte , impossible ! " the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , "why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ? do you think it incredible that Mr collins should be able to procure any woman 's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. 3.8812050584085633
"and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ! oh , that i knew how it was ! " but wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. 3.616070598585994
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr wickham with money. 3.5350002140777934
" the tumult of elizabeth 's mind was allayed by this conversation. 3.852680022201668
" "it is difficult indeed it is distressing. 2.9452289034067047
but i must write no more. 3.522359152530146
every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight. 4.088216073451514
she will be down in a moment i dare say. 4.034089538408657
it was really a very handsome thought. 3.655452939546369
" "i have been making the tour of the park , " he replied , "as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage. 3.178642118721985
" "well , and what news does it bring ? good or bad ? " "what is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket ; "but perhaps you would like to read it. 3.121656087773789
" miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives. 3.8833388604406824
nor was darcy 's vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery. 4.161211651363055
with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning. 3.445322812790558

"i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man 's intimates in the regiment , whether wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. 3.3785998338639507
" "i should not be surprised , " said darcy , "if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers. 3.7053841345475687
" "i am not now to learn , " replied Mr collins , with a formal wave of the hand , "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time. 3.5081488521938953
" "i am not going to run away , papa , " said kitty , fretfully ; "if i should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia. 3.418200539877165
" "this is quite shocking ! he deserves to be publicly disgraced. 3.569774653372734
in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief. 4.128883283445186
dear me ! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster 's. 3.5153451474572623
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks. 3.5262583674626478
they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs bennet 's civilities. 3.0801093510393027
i cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family. 3.458215771242512
" it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. 3.9192747564869115
he had to be sure done much. 4.045647671389809
my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr darcy , to be treating his father 's favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for. 3.681941450701483
hear me in silence. 4.559064331029575
" the loss of her daughter made Mrs bennet very dull for several days. 3.0884241203110925
but at length , by elizabeth 's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city. 4.055669834489995
she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so. 3.0607030715553543
i cannot do justice to his kindness. 2.9892273914701892
that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. 3.429366455469057
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner. 3.3284916010598398
but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. 3.1480947091739675
arguments are too much like disputes. 4.0833131327438785
he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else. 3.9343958060650666
" "sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said Mrs bennet , alarmed. 4.009388824405789
Mrs philips 's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley 's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar. 4.018249059069841
if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. 4.083918327889568
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. 3.1151623584199357
i certainly have had my share of beauty , but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. 3.942967728603889
mary 's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected. 3.5874130565433013
the morrow produced no abatement of Mrs bennet 's ill humour or ill health. 4.0241691772113395
i quite detest the man. 4.107259690004995
" "is he married or single ? " "oh ! single , my dear , to be sure ! a single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year. 3.024761055782158
" Mr wickham 's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife 's. 3.1848002927891677
" most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote. 3.126577258829677
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity. 3.1090630342769208
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself. 3.3108317102230895
Mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , - "this walk is not wide enough for our party. 3.50970584383399
"he is certainly a good brother , " said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows. 4.030486220203371
" "this is a wretched beginning indeed ! my sole dependence was on you ; and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not. 3.1962892667196203
she does not yet leave her dressing room. 3.587968687741886
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes ' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out. 3.867082959047873
things are settled so oddly. 4.155263301513342
" "i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , "that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness. 3.308529372885311
" "it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends. 3.8563582615001115
from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day. 3.4800262004751272
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange. 3.754097057324356
many stared. 4.227086278761312
no arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent 's mind. 3.3452440092930944
" elizabeth was distressed. 2.8864116964106206
on the strength of darcy 's regard bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion. 4.2934994727678015
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. 3.9020975560602356
" "but if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required. 2.7670316915517956
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once. 3.381012670155533
but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister 's indifference. 4.000613548883902
but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. 3.7847893998909283
and then we were so merry all the way home ! we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! " to this , mary very gravely replied , "far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures. 3.541658181637714
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it. 3.5680769321797454
lydia 's voice was heard in the vestibule ; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room. 3.135695190878081
do let me ask my partner to introduce you. 3.039724285797151
Mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. 3.958033177987745
but i think Mr darcy improves on acquaintance. 3.8451220028306445
she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged Mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. 4.141076083446121
their fortune on both sides is splendid. 3.3552804587615888
miss bingley 's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr darcy 's progress through his book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page. 3.4799438754938317
"what do you mean , Mr bennet , by talking in this way ? you promised me to insist upon her marrying him. 3.0248473699232172
his doing so drew her notice. 3.3863227445505553
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used. 3.669824992279955
" "well , then supposing them to be in london. 2.9316806773896777
only think of that my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. 3.4471479925819457
" "perfectly so i thank you. 3.5112438444371277
you see on what a footing we are. 3.9359481409336974
they were of a respectable family in the north of england ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother 's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade. 3.3274048634753846
she read over her aunt 's commendation of him again and again. 3.415723035787726
for my part , Mr bingley , i always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up differently. 3.1220919508397933
Number with active links or immediate access to the full terms of the project gutenberg tm license. 2.998647304006653
i am happier even than jane ; she only smiles , i laugh. 3.172991826510136
"i see what you are feeling , " replied charlotte , - "you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr collins was wishing to marry you. 3.7484271253584067
mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them. 3.894887433337396
" "i know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder. 3.31459475332628

"you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , i am sure , to oblige us for one half hour. 3.697981922111993
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. 3.824889617551707
but georgiana would not join her. 3.5251650658229385
we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all. 3.668694740906459
they then went away. 3.2058836769511356
they had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about. 3.5671795310586565
but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding. 4.043569762223795
to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. 3.7746157919236634
she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , "by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield ? i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure. 3.4141458851957838
you see how continually we are engaged there. 3.438033023715315
Mrs bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone Mr collins began. 3.5243145981558914
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , i should not pay him half so much deference. 3.4146585872855097
i was ready to die of laughter. 3.331323965806733
" "it was a subject which they could not mention before me. 3.75062017574694
jane was distressed. 3.2548943837723594
let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. 3.5112137857954653
" "my dear Mr bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. 3.5719765293313674
kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy. 4.094147181595225
their powers of conversation were considerable. 3.466222274556475
till this moment , i never knew myself. 4.206727910174278
darcy was delighted with their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of it. 3.5031155559676956
but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair. 3.7772428250798287
my excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant. 3.817651831517808
i mend pens remarkably well. 3.54281301768565
" "laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. 3.4734225332097934
" "i certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said darcy , "of conversing easily with those i have never seen before. 3.5204669832041575
Mr bennet treated the matter differently. 3.285279498902182
in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy 's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible. 3.8315334419356892
while sir william was with them , Mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road. 3.7119899214042102
i cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done. 3.2878819326006523
the consequence of it is , that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have , and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. 4.0788129194448866
you never see a fault in any body. 3.5512553173621018
at that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion. 3.051515481402009
" "you have only proved by this , " cried elizabeth , "that Mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. 3.326213693601615
her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , "why is he so altered ? from what can it proceed ? it cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened. 3.193041596706133
e. 2.515032492749843
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity. 3.7136622903423464
in spite of her deeply rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man 's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger. 3.6547778048982877
in a short time , i shall have a daughter married. 3.980676089547622
we all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. 4.1331974826291
she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body. 3.560494754652423
" "and this , " cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , "is your opinion of me ! this is the estimation in which you hold me ! i thank you for explaining it so fully. 3.664318489687194
"wickham so very bad ! it is almost past belief. 3.962173395263936
" it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. 3.2874470857960527
bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them. 3.893422972202906
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before. 3.577566257327145
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home , and see if i can make it up any better. 3.9428913657928746
do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will. 4.042284621030644
e. 2.515032492749843
and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ? we cannot suppose he would help it , if he could. 3.013689822683731
the officers will find women better worth their notice. 3.1089053628743595
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king , during his mayoralty. 3.6744443317711477
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father. 3.571070023286897
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia , and , removed from the influence of lydia 's example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid. 3.3059292914551146
she could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present. 3.7151614919355325
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister 's room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. 3.777923400790459
"it taught me to hope , " said he , "as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. 3.5708639613275506
chapter xii. 2.2111971152442003
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her. 4.554134569774698
" lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was. 3.450981920357017
" "yes ; but intricate characters are the most amusing. 3.104441372113242
why was he to be the judge ? " "you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " "i do not see what right Mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend 's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. 3.6539478964452927
"there is nothing the matter with me. 2.961237344311895
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise. 3.615815597781243
" Mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication. 3.065196378970607
"my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? " said her aunt. 4.218838149157413
it is evident that you belong to the first circles. 4.23416291733699
multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets (example : m ^ {rs } ). 3.624951771713463
but , my dearest jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend. 3.388784054017581
" "is my father in town ? " "yes , he went on tuesday as i wrote you word. 3.369883390934683
" "i am not likely to leave kent for some time. 3.045849485612944
you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its being created. 5.095154028946338
he had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it. 3.4238858183357967
and with no one to speak to , of what i felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had ! oh ! how i wanted you ! " "how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to Mr darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved. 3.639341442415564
i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen. 3.6965937069715915
her reflections were in general satisfactory. 3.7780623410570793
"if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , "i shall know how to understand it. 3.622269351473454
she shared in their attendance on Mrs bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom. 3.9501412676965257
" she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held. 3.6665623824035114
they will ruin your happiness. 3.070388380820828
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her. 3.7525371108797736
" but of this answer lydia heard not a word. 3.0624977585611193
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related. 3.6213903581399154
to pemberley , therefore , they were to go. 4.96349834347406
chapter xvii. 2.857179731996027
regard for my sister 's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to Mr wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs younge was of course removed from her charge. 4.179391143219085
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme. 3.0358252129722905
" "and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added kitty. 3.1464506867687962
you mentioned two instances. 3.788415947259339
pray make my excuses to pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to night. 4.227923553018783
when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when Mrs philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine 's drawing rooms , and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper 's room. 3.5007574030954456
" another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment. 3.7195388806965197
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool 's errand again. 4.035249949169376
chapter x. 2.857179731996027
miss bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room. 3.966265089339852
my dear hill , have you heard the good news ? miss lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding. 3.7442278432430935
chapter i. 2.8769320920124106
find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her. 3.9228019199872137
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. 3.6634852326637257
how i long to see her ! and to see dear wickham too ! but the clothes , the wedding clothes ! i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly. 3.3610032350739494
elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased. 3.347803267525465
as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. 3.6739862074340572
every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh. 3.9026295169989544
anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil. 3.6027123765888596
pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned. 3.9044828404159055
the carriage was sent to meet them at - , and they were to return in it , by dinner time. 4.13873958362659
"what does Mr darcy mean , " said she to charlotte , "by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? " "that is a question which Mr darcy only can answer. 3.302615428522462
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself. 3.4057440981623563
"but to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable. 3.2705789289818705
every thing nourishes what is strong already. 3.61766606417842
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! " she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister 's spirits. 3.6595312911159144
" "what you ask , " said elizabeth , "is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr darcy had much better finish his letter. 3.749123598114793
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. 3.4591892391839902
you must not suspect me. 3.458585150727905
there could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs philips 's supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body. 3.2012802865808796
he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn. 3.352290038444735
nor did that day wear out her resentment. 3.509280516018537
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from thence to the library ; their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , "if you are looking for my master , ma 'am , he is walking towards the little copse. 3.7272235084650864
" "i shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own. 3.457422445160123
" "that is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily. 3.856997152443379
her own thoughts were employing her. 3.7173235741448525
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. 3.322929142221241
i have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude. 3.667135642061841
but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew. 3.918249148833761
he has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers. 3.6300628131138817
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man. 3.223925844120975
"about a month , " said elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , "he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i understand. 3.749093247377789
jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. 3.618276066483468
" "she did indeed , louisa. 3.1865706660547115
but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain. 3.5526356656747686
e. 2.515032492749843
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything. 3.030268455691106
will you tell me how long you have loved him ? " "it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began. 3.825338461885056
i am very , very sorry. 3.347940699769773
the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter. 4.259612907330508
such a countenance , such manners ! and so extremely accomplished for her age ! her performance on the piano forte is exquisite. 3.0919456076927916
"but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope every thing will be well. 4.031911445829489
" "i cannot pretend to be sorry , " said wickham , after a short interruption , "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with him i believe it does not often happen. 4.070021178739619
as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister. 3.6017639337988325
" "his manners are very different from his cousin 's. 3.599392201713247
" "perhaps we might be deceived. 3.1809514211840333
" "but you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit. 3.1833683156124013
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention. 3.3740166488201915
she approached , and saw the likeness of Mr wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle piece. 4.108476005428344
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; Mr darcy looked up. 3.451906611717634
my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can 't write ; so i will dictate , and you write for me. 4.25890090492736
Number. 2.239615789728809
her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Mr darcy 's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much. 3.6141301899321037
Mrs hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr darcy 's eyes were fixed on her. 3.340644088260055
at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction. 2.9753200098307184
it was unpardonable. 3.474314759220054
his pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure. 3.443803204101385
"my dear niece , "i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you. 4.1433654236785395
"but it is fortunate , " thought she , "that i have something to wish for. 3.215496182511544
when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. 3.853307621450821
but Mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. 2.9599135822207736
" she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where Mr hurst had a house. 3.3094060396008027
what will you think of my vanity ? i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses. 3.3960730159663797
a younger son , you know , must be inured to self denial and dependence. 4.14436132818273
he was angry. 3.5492069263870194
how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family ! when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham 's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful. 3.5677521139185053
their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr and Mrs gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country. 3.611572261857092
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. 3.0994195316181816
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town , where the family did not visit. 3.630608579019645
"you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age. 3.487410068108036
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor. 3.725697367540214
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners. 4.223093452014003
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough ; and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. 3.478990120494196
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. 3.589655042890891
far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , "to resent the behaviour of your daughter. 3.490513176445943
human nature is so prone to fall into it ! no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame. 4.654141639202675
e. 2.515032492749843
the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him. 3.7994403822096325
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea. 3.551530282878286
"now i am quite happy , " said she , "for you will be as happy as myself. 4.2256587533871315
Mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard. 3.926496280443536
nothing could console and nothing appease her. 3.3243371779639688
for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him. 3.824685635771866
let me do it without farther loss of time. 3.136522061913914
she dared not even mention that gentleman. 3.3880860939650006
it was over at last however. 3.392848095776334
respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. 3.6452813674470734
when the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time. 3.8358089426707433
but she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. 3.2637618272949753
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family. 3.4649061593927346
my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself. 3.970390270587808
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on. 3.5704662822095274
he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger. 3.44755703501098
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter , and concluded with her brother 's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country. 3.1664615231334072
" "is this , " thought elizabeth , "meant for me ? " and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , "and pray , what is the usual price of an earl 's younger son ? unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds. 3.5389917649509437
wickham is safe. 4.044072904630321
i cannot blame myself for having done thus much. 3.2094010861617366
" "oh ! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road. 3.358516595744234
my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying Mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did. 3.487566714864771
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing. 3.7402077028927443
" "you mistake me , my dear. 3.598561817132713
she got up , and ran out of the room ; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour. 3.324478639925375
" "what is it you mean ? " "it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady 's family , it would be an unpleasant thing. 3.4564333676373566
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. 3.466804104338067
"i did not know that you intended to walk , " said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard. 3.7982516967212683
"well , lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , "and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ? well , well , i only hope it will last. 3.453016257065381
"but it is not merely this affair , " she continued , "on which my dislike is founded. 3.4170727998449624
"but i can assure you , " she added , "that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing. 3.393800551000327
" "nothing is more deceitful , " said darcy , "than the appearance of humility. 4.646917877236803
tell him what a dreadful state i am in , that i am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day. 4.605858563707877
i enquired after their brother , of course. 4.134676538919586
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude. 3.5882595686578878
" to catherine and lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. 3.192306347913869
" the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte 's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. 3.7547740247699446
when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to Mr bingley. 3.30664552025775
she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress. 4.200462420845657
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. 3.471659258953395
when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year ; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both. 3.1779578327796187
miss bingley was engrossed by Mr darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her. 3.649476121086551
"she did not choose it , " said her daughter , "she would go. 4.212692865060325

he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it. 3.63377416015268
a few days after this visit , Mr bingley called again , and alone. 4.224069457873457
the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention. 3.5239408934631355

the lucases are very artful people indeed , sister. 3.4834848422386666
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while Mr darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth 's person , behaviour , and dress. 3.3952800010480124
" " Mr darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. 3.5930337891505393
jane now came up. 3.8234973409946424
the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her. 3.520741701239442
" "your picture may be very exact , louisa , " said bingley ; "but this was all lost upon me. 3.8027784219018526
her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object. 3.686372828887648

" "well , my dear , " said Mr bennet , when elizabeth had read the note aloud , "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr bingley , and under your orders. 3.869134234306998

"i told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Mr darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. 3.929576261825017
"how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , Mr darcy , " she cried ; "i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter. 3.541543214305065

he was my godfather , and excessively attached to me. 4.241701185473398
pemberley was now georgiana 's home ; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see. 3.967616972945032
but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most. 3.128635709876108
" "ah ! you do not know what i suffer. 3.5789164462328915
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. 3.566858306103935

" "you must not blame my aunt. 2.9791941276947442
but on returning to the drawing room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. 3.9069754864899395
though lydia had never been a favourite with them , Mr and Mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected. 3.8400911765398753
i must find Mr gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed ; i have not an instant to lose. 3.418030359985878

we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. 3.045363551546951
" "i would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried bingley , "for a kingdom ! upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as i have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty. 3.437631143221537
it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling. 3.0778753501337195
but however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so. 3.7625742469851313
"but depend upon it , Mr collins , " she added , "that lizzy shall be brought to reason. 3.3275755024882105
she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. 4.44169458705813
"i am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said lady catherine ; "and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal. 4.509292116053361
" "if you mean darcy , " cried her brother , "he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards. 3.745004663853486
i believe him to be lady catherine 's nephew. 4.5994566872609095
she could not think of darcy 's leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him. 4.0353176396497314
"i often think , " said she , "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one 's friends. 3.491245894927286
kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon. 3.44297407762178
the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master 's steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence. 3.7695329384713347
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud. 3.355636345261193
in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger. 3.925044308666558
" "miss bingley told me , " said jane , "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance. 3.2336229482445216
" no one made any reply. 3.1820353558557266
i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall i own that i long for your return ? i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient. 4.2069026794631705
Number through Number. 2.794816627156603
thank heaven ! he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves. 3.1475022296778854
but are you pleased , jane ? shall you like to have such a brother ? " "very , very much. 3.3943120829288054
i believe i have now told you every thing. 3.3304685170762878
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states. 2.8931256213730747
his character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr darcy 's sister , as , by wickham 's account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away. 3.7238283765798434
" elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. 3.6323607418453374
his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , "what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ? what is it you are talking of ? what are you telling miss bennet ? let me hear what it is. 3.526669033769008
"and may i ask ? " said elizabeth , "but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with. 3.562208682341639
the compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt. 4.640438146812337
"you begin to comprehend me , do you ? " cried he , turning towards her. 3.520002318939636
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. 4.356186877349688
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried. 3.627608364323785
i am quite well. 3.6568439735669966
we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her. 3.6861386312714077
his attachment to rosings , certainly increases. 3.554075822868259
as a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. 3.5727739899819477
he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay. 3.595657666296648
" "my dear aunt , this is being serious indeed. 3.182641422029752
"good gracious ! lord bless me ! only think ! dear me ! Mr darcy ! who would have thought it ! and is it really true ? oh ! my sweetest lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be ! what pin money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! jane 's is nothing to it nothing at all. 3.284372505133427
" "it is from miss bingley , " said jane , and then read it aloud. 4.010012868524743
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be. 3.4055590976985455
two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them. 3.723825623075992
* * * * * "good gracious ! " cried Mrs bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , "if that disagreeable Mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley ! what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company. 3.474564793163445
now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. 3.85281412176948
lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation. 3.790826152111182
" "lizzy , " said her father , "i have given him my consent. 3.7311504466196252
what a stroke was this for poor jane ! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual. 3.351487092229577
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon. 3.410227610582256
but now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err. 3.1988953726405667
Mr gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation. 3.3776628362334904
in spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation. 4.712725840153691
i send no compliments to your mother. 3.7695927091452752
" "take care , lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment. 3.009016744643816
"lizzy , " said he , "what are you doing ? are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? have not you always hated him ? " how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr darcy. 3.363325744410347
however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham. 4.26280176204648
her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it. 3.558193916825638
" "of whom does jane ever think ill ? and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is. 3.2420547158525492
" Mrs bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library. 3.664647321714565
his countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely opened his lips. 3.5555546388611403
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits. 4.4044044880967
it was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long. 3.978192831323239
" a long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and Mrs bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. 3.5876989651025384

she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be Mr darcy , she moved again towards the gate. 3.4414680530353303
it is enough to know they are discovered , i have seen them both " "then it is , as i always hoped , " cried jane ; "they are married ! " elizabeth read on ; "i have seen them both. 3.6989021147663297
there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning. 4.137187212401991
he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her. 3.4653615928498156
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information. 4.15620822817668
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane 's happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring. 4.955806498580273
" "but my father cannot. 3.3997594143727903
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. 3.1092429694816435
elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london. 3.8167772780687854
not a syllable was uttered by either ; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room. 3.1589035019408764

in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her. 3.7660815702480113
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. 3.1206689716314537
remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body 's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin. 3.8168028807093015

at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance. 4.587642844211751
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen. 3.1977964694780603
"you used us abominably ill , " answered Mrs hurst , "in running away without telling us that you were coming out. 3.3672266998168356

while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came. 3.9682344503795215
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. 3.972796989529245
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage. 4.07959723204268
but every body is to judge for themselves , and the lucases are very good sort of girls , i assure you. 3.760984586989621
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while Mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor. 3.7323488110998633
Mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months. 3.2412501855298315
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr bingley will not be detained in london by them. 3.3709608589025244
he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , "i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. 3.7805593023599378
elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william 's too long. 4.534076773875512
lydia was a stout , well grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. 3.640612127756828
" he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away. 2.889517060906156
and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , (for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time. 3.020530047095947
"it must not be thought of. 3.8640715055265256
but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship 's praise into his own hands. 3.69199545574051
wickham will never marry a woman without some money. 3.24393318366251
my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. 3.553134890991663
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. 2.9237376390762435
" "shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? " said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam. 3.4472256707639657
"e. 2.8443557756472804
jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way. 4.452250296400454
i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject. 3.9517617471807136
it will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance. 3.199391856084056
" "much more rational , my dear caroline , i dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball. 3.7523303036164544

this son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. 3.669868939164349
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , "how long did you say that he was at rosings ? " "nearly three weeks. 3.926222483959074
his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing. 3.9418995780182664
at night she opened her heart to jane. 3.5891253427871788
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere. 3.298310037264379
though Mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. 4.722606095549247
compliments always take you by surprise , and me never. 3.8226868272719514
i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from you. 3.1617004087848466
but you have chosen your fault well. 3.191716571526485
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? if they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed. 3.422145206173441
" elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; but Mrs bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed. 3.2896715176297224
i am afraid you will be angry. 3.2138226004375
he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company. 3.3763283413061633
i did not think Mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted. 3.620837410514001
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister 's being in town. 3.460573573462979
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her. 4.294075249834682
i do not think it is very pretty ; but i thought i might as well buy it as not. 3.889876798166394
on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. 3.347267583974281
it is not quite a week since they left brighton. 3.2750017221989713
in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account. 3.4895433156984925
Mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire. 3.7825526302918058
he placed himself by her. 3.7737112383027256
miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern in parting with her , that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present. 3.7578370897382096
" "i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. 3.055911788084512
Mr wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Mr darcy just deigned to return. 3.1513969166243223
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. 3.451220478169148
have you never happened to see her there ? " she was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet. 3.8168913285093833
" chapter xiii. 2.633869105314287
how you must have hated me after that evening ? " "hate you ! i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction. 3.563487441930215
perhaps she is full young to be much in company. 3.605852915942512
all were struck with the stranger 's air , all wondered who he could be , and kitty and lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot. 3.3951554781452993
he is gone to my father already. 3.655208920626749
wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison. 3.857562165379695
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. 3.7050487985329217
mamma would like to go too of all things ! only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! " "yes , " thought elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once. 3.6322466834181926
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling. 3.847203179942716
see Number h. 4.076451527956932
" Mrs gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of jane and elizabeth 's correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation. 4.06609642096552
but my dear lydia , i don 't at all like your going such a way off. 3.226302030635869
to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley 's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own. 3.6911199479233403
" "oh ! it is of no consequence. 3.6246544181883564
the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure ; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence. 3.741061687634612
i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company. 4.109407016168321
we do not suffer by accident. 3.2297498947664844
i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. 3.3488476570920813

when she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner 's in town , so much in love with her , that my sister inlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. 3.6040899497784653
they have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better. 3.0141779727973628
he is perfectly amiable. 3.4724062923594543
"but it is , " returned she ; "for Mrs long has just been here , and she told me all about it. 3.577661406557828
it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration. 4.037073356676782
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life. 3.549579224850743
it cannot last long. 3.501236237668484
people do not die of little trifling colds. 3.1746542785837146
"i hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , "you will give your mother inlaw a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers. 3.968742472641937
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. 3.624284449025579
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening. 2.808226620989475
i congratulate her. 4.154544371138459
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman 's family. 4.878581789601307
she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. 3.4131943025819185
balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters. 3.482602943622922
"pray do , my dear miss lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , "for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves. 3.667370321427885
after a short silence , the lady first spoke. 3.3461534635989256
i cannot misunderstand you , but i intreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk. 3.591866981193945
she was very equal therefore to address Mr bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. 3.9018162386418993
there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected. 3.4515743057282866
Mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. 3.279909871140715
" jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness. 3.620121962708474
never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings. 3.2711647954326155
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible. 3.4139002131302623
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it. 3.4746028418120356
Mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless. 4.177779821765451
" "in what an amiable light does this place him ! " thought elizabeth. 3.3049040786784314
he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister. 3.8459198542062722
anxiety on jane 's behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Mr darcy 's explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost. 3.8263206755830965
we want none of them ; do we ? " darcy had walked away to another part of the room. 3.5159354631562616
on Mr and Mrs gardiner 's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness. 3.8776851110544595
" "was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , while she was ill at netherfield ? " "dearest jane ! who could have done less for her ? but make a virtue of it by all means. 3.350677455090249
he was on one side of her mother. 3.776912149276447
this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed. 4.383400179409115
charlotte had seen them from her husband 's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , "i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility. 3.5802310054222874
i should say , one of her ladyship 's carriages , for she has several. 4.135772872955948
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in kent ? " "i have heard from authority , which i thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron. 3.853674353825944
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. 2.9825603535583887
she will make him a very proper wife. 3.7078519330051916
"are you not diverted ? " "oh ! yes. 4.0840059480545525
all elizabeth 's anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again. 3.4198883337738843
" "his pride , " said miss lucas , "does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it. 3.8922820239506675
let us hope for better things. 2.9049980282223054
" Mr collins , " said she , "speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman. 3.6935742761106107
nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece. 3.4209072986600986
we must not make him desperate. 3.3270059674838
in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which jane was equally eager to satisfy. 3.314810520917073
"how near it may be to mine , i cannot pretend to say. 3.892752516273423
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. 3.557586900346285
" "aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if i had known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. 3.702247779337786
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing. 3.6676410826703036
lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , i dare say Mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball. 3.334386276336482
the discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly. 3.4404709250601093
but i can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise. 3.827572178568226
he has not an ill natured look. 3.428515020286686
Mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips. 3.0686529822025377
" "obstinate , headstrong girl ! i am ashamed of you ! is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? is nothing due to me on that score ? "let us sit down. 2.989041133871079
Mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet. 3.9289894669048553
he seldom appeared really animated. 3.5136628813384547
i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day. 4.674053566985412
Mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. 3.9672771894890695
do you play and sing , miss bennet ? " "a little. 3.3023090855105224

"i have every reason in the world to think ill of you. 3.6795267105741423

he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend. 3.3039997224383484
every object in the next day 's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight. 3.7094942538736837
" "a man who had felt less , might. 3.2382318962594883

"i am afraid , Mr darcy , " observed miss bingley , in a half whisper , "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes. 3.5163896312932463
well ! i am so happy. 4.9805884302325865
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton. 3.2496563029377343
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. 3.20170963483843
" "and then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books. 3.5242687191445183
oh ! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. 3.3976280429293646
never mind miss lizzy 's hair. 3.5333156050221737
there is one point , on which i want your advice. 3.5139562149830708
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. 3.2982012286696474
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. 3.8327887981770106
"why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , "did he come at all ? " she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure. 3.6857909706092356
" "and what am i to do on the occasion ? it seems an hopeless business. 3.1505696315456473
" "impossible , Mr bennet , impossible , when i am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? " "i honour your circumspection. 3.7294915873229977
that reply will do for the present. 3.6300184176769195
their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast room. 4.09224606804021
she would be in nobody 's way , you know , in that part of the house. 4.027186444502597
" as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane. 3.6747310482058455
it was as follows : "my dear sir , "i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire. 3.3550969052341566
"while mary is adjusting her ideas , " he continued , "let us return to Mr bingley. 3.546076479363204
is not it so , Mrs bennet ? " "yes , or i will never see her again. 3.8669213739192143
but to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult. 3.148888979058749
they could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr bingley 's large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign. 3.714876510451072
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same. 3.748062995623915
" "but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? " "it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , "that a sister 's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. 3.5575837912680863
chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for my sake ; and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way. 3.353282092729623
" "well , then , you need not be under any alarm. 3.0375762648526337
elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth. 4.295620294215893
" "did not you ? i did for you. 3.2875661547071484
colonel fitzwilliam 's manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings. 3.8295591630682106
" she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success. 3.456233079398592
Mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane ; but as he took up his abode with the lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs bennet. 3.3170571629291956
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him ! he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! not handsome enough to dance with ! i wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs. 3.5319132928013106
he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure i never want to see him again. 3.6326609858792587
" jane shook her head. 2.792448698103359
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other. 3.1481976031290353
Mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton. 3.668424580607956
such doings discomposed Mr bennet exceedingly. 3.5143497253181275
" their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. 3.195588508251538
" while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. 3.5096541047127015

that he was surprised by the connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with Mr gardiner. 4.222832663239038
she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents. 3.4909224439707724
she was engaged one day as she walked , in re perusing jane 's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her. 3.367844017783547
" miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister 's warm affection. 3.1244301801800756
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. 3.7126293773217247
she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. 3.097328819532136

the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away. 3.7935385995636186
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. 3.3009971560258378
but , however , that shan 't prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined. 3.870606073198964
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter. 3.4699659237657237

forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante. 4.337363756083599
we may compare our different opinions. 3.448089525425692
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations. 3.594442332656636
elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them. 3.317353814604631
elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from pemberley. 3.367280717765641
"you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other 's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , i should be completely in your way ; and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire. 3.531936870991522

" but jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Mr bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public. 3.633278663827436
i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to. 3.098675850158291
lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome. 2.9754002775365422
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house , i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , monday , november Numberth , by four o 'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se 'night following , which i can do without any inconvenience , as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. 3.069651198051061
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. 3.1424803392072493

the horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them. 4.193629582230193
Mrs wickham ! how well it sounds. 3.8603237850344208
i should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing. 4.062903955614176
" "well , " said charlotte , "i wish jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. 3.522728282709721
"but , " he added , "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here. 3.571903006127953
he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting. 3.5362824381032554
" Mr gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; Mrs reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister. 3.1379344851847732
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself. 3.4661068674301156
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names. 3.238927777424775
" "but does lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ? " "oh , yes ! that , that is the worst of all. 3.3028617005102485
" elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room. 3.392464278138923
this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr wickham. 3.7789068832662958
u. 2.8443557756472804
he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided. 3.8230791406479305
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. 3.590713276893709
yes , there was something in that ; i told you so from the first , you may remember. 4.277159475153387
when Mrs bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before. 3.5764364028649194
but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her. 3.4250350808915626
"my dear , dear aunt , " she rapturously cried , "what delight ! what felicity ! you give me fresh life and vigour. 3.2827736971473516
the situation of your mother 's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father. 3.3542354240101413
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling. 3.3275847984200166
that he has neither integrity nor honour. 3.6946810756655313
" "yes , indeed , " cried Mrs bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. 3.3377977400059473
presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on. 3.3275276590301206
" "an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth. 3.2678488133975763
i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. 2.9524111336359367
with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which Mr darcy afterwards discharged. 3.650582218740642
" she was gone directly. 3.656528780054975
i have not been used to submit to any person 's whims. 3.102968430786634
he readily agreed to it. 3.698448735252076
i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr collins 's character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state. 3.3032914245591285
elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham 's name. 3.924333763336519
i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement. 3.7313850371155257
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you. 4.007132167632729
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; i do not know what to say to you. 3.6642021956759767
allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , (glancing at her sister and bingley , ) shall take place. 3.956375610703046
"yours , &c. 2.5717791604913125

it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance. 3.414287069382207
it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane 's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. 3.8136005988376094
and when you have given your ball , " she added , "i shall insist on their giving one also. 3.3421739548366998

but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house. 2.9932826447136702
"my dear madam , " he replied , "this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible. 3.624042443058224

" Mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. 3.7245423957819965
she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour. 3.0161190536931253
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. 3.3212183948002516
elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend. 3.5504086081755757
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness , and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due. 3.705617364094933
"to jane herself , " she exclaimed , "there could be no possibility of objection. 4.071155922506601
these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not. 3.2149580789345595
their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! let me never see either one or the other again ! " yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover. 3.271025736164839
"good gracious ! " cried maria , after a few minutes silence , "it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! " "a great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh. 3.29907897966186
there was no want of discourse. 3.257856430073185
they had not been long together , before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley 's quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room. 3.5883240225659834
i know it to be impossible. 2.722624952729565
upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. 4.756913139547006
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday. 3.7076543743361046
" then shewing her purchases : "look here , i have bought this bonnet. 3.716146822375517
her mind was less difficult to develope. 3.393748935999715
no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it. 3.7019048948654065
" this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least. 3.644522238175382
" to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent Mr bingley 's being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his. 3.8616537348779634
Mr collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied , "it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably. 3.4125578208948526
"i know little of the game , at present , " said he , "but i shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life " Mrs philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason. 3.5098549567236654
Mr denny and Mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr philips 's house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydia 's pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs philips ' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation. 4.723719186113579
" and upon elizabeth 's seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , "lizzy , i insist upon your staying and hearing Mr collins. 2.9979805062640508
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your 's. 3.536813521890868
she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become "stupid , disagreeable fellows. 3.663428835628592
but really , ma 'am , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. 3.335844707770447
" "and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason. 3.3107282618026814
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement. 4.665177217897047
it was first broken by Mrs annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on. 3.04266072335598
they had several children. 3.3524890311183637
" "yes ; he introduced us to his sister. 3.018906856801922
at length however Mrs bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. 3.357610629801448
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection. 3.0950829509211566
"only think of its being three months , " she cried , "since i went away ; it seems but a fortnight i declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. 3.448592606462498
"you are quite a visit in my debt , Mr bingley , " she added , "for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned. 3.4503193324650643
"i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news. 3.5460965789110177
Mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast. 3.3683296089634527
she really looked almost wild. 3.673738855277914
one morning , about a week after bingley 's engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. 3.6615341688407312
kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. 3.7172327533107947
but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival of jane. 4.219369474461784
they were , therefore , to go. 3.7684228498011683
till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for Mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. 3.7422042142832805
chapter xi. 2.857179731996027
she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject. 3.6777473928432607
we passed each other several times. 3.4174049061056895
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. 3.7932563951109546
no one but Mrs bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home. 3.587177084612097
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior. 3.080589756618444
my father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. 3.451819873811578
but perhaps Mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle. 3.5128443976957584
Mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant 's commission in the shire. 3.8940201068692972
" the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair. 3.830104965262865
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants. 3.9151209528163458
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. 3.536812845446164
"how can you be so silly , " cried her mother , "as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! you will not be fit to be seen when you get there. 3.869595940815854
how long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am i to wish you joy ? " "that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask. 3.221521673867244
"you certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome. 3.8592024367841486
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose. 3.5013680409681287
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. 3.6345753123710614
his plan did not vary on seeing them. 4.270350574888139
the day of his and lydia 's departure soon came , and Mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth. 3.6938925213361347
a lively imagination soon settled it all. 3.48809091098485
miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place. 3.363582798122667
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all. 3.3686705197528153
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine 's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte 's observation , and hurried her away to her room. 3.36031813370705
" "do you really think so ? " cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment. 3.6451759459021806
it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts. 4.269752015529593
a clergyman like you must marry. 3.488665942847406
" "whatever i do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; "and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes. 3.571252077316873
" "oh ! no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. 2.9943789976475212
on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was. 3.780030175122989

" "i am far from attributing any part of Mr bingley 's conduct to design , " said elizabeth ; "but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery. 3.7128517066711675

" "is that his design in settling here ? " "design ! nonsense , how can you talk so ! but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes. 3.9029175961458478

" "i am afraid you do not like your pen. 3.4727722055480696
elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother 's schemes. 3.649219220911811
and you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner. 3.478434749591489
" you began the evening well , charlotte , " said Mrs bennet with civil self command to miss lucas. 3.5291217034714597
had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend 's permission , or being bold enough to come without it. 3.884826646386995
i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection. 3.7494645445890935
- "whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment. 3.3424038376797647
to this speech bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend 's vulgar relations. 4.088714692337129
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday. 3.1821839036904365
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak. 3.884736087796989
smiles decked the face of Mrs bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy. 3.376806856547723
"i did not think caroline in spirits , " were her words , "but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london. 3.875085140147256
" Mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt 's ill breeding , and made no answer. 3.184068306957562
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin. 3.336109919018605
Mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. 3.55661636324765
he has given in all his debts ; i hope at least he has not deceived us. 3.294399602563609

" but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation. 3.4373278462196644
perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. 2.8526239234194164
when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. 3.697521320470661
" "we will be down as soon as we can , " said jane ; "but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago. 4.335119927768705
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met. 3.766362825086777

long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided. 3.7317352836353166
i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at. 3.1812319132669233
he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility. 3.9143711833576336
"i do , indeed , " replied elizabeth , colouring. 3.726011433948348
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from Mrs gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. 3.6153521114464726

she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine. 3.7110092755468074
they are gone off together from brighton. 2.8908565531761274
but my feelings are not only cordial towards him ; they are even impartial towards miss king. 3.1432011620038938
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which i cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. 3.7143776244405218
" "let her be called down. 3.293757868705858
" "i suspected as much , " replied elizabeth. 3.582603804160742
the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground. 3.145562926602885
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend 's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power. 3.791031729466642
the old lady is Mrs jenkinson , who lives with them. 3.3037518165764914
" "insolent girl ! " said elizabeth to herself. 4.338288834366356
there was also a postscript to this effect. 2.9458733609399324

dear , dear lizzy. 4.568579513857168
allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety. 3.6101621969704616
"you are a good girl ; " he replied , "and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. 3.5883093177339864
she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and i understand highly accomplished. 3.4046790650625587

she was sorry that Mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister 's refusal must have given him. 3.5613575435957507

in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. 3.6311128457120883

" "what should not you mind ? " "i should not mind any thing at all. 3.406274068922195
such formidable accounts of her ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened maria lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at st. 3.7198004842591
she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave. 4.103118064767884
" "she had better have stayed at home , " cried elizabeth ; "perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one 's neighbours. 3.6011446700433076
" "oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! " "perhaps it would have been better ; " replied her sister. 3.535614718467259
of having another daughter married to Mr collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure. 4.157078924028629

"next time you call , " said she , "i hope we shall be more lucky. 3.636202330699967
"i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball. 3.5143004926302135
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away. 3.1112349974937605
within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. 3.841887950208938

except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph Number. 2.730846692306109
Mrs gardiner 's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : "you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly. 3.574272406075739
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. 2.6766173898089836
"oh ! " said she , "i heard you before ; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply. 3.711683794286184
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty. 3.376083288160178
" "except , " thought elizabeth , "when she goes to ramsgate. 3.4826189465516517
' she did indeed. 3.982932250829506
" "i had much rather go in the coach. 2.934637494406203

" "do let us have a little music , " cried miss bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share. 4.125664743199978
but you do not know all. 4.250051332391151
when at length they arose to take leave , Mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation. 3.5362259982478603

i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite 's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better. 2.9506537107622592
from his garden , Mr collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while sir william accompanied him , charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband 's help. 3.583334705940328

" "oh ! no it is not for me to be driven away by Mr darcy. 3.1428283342493994
of this she was perfectly unaware ; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with. 3.4676766540185247

"you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire , my dear cousin. 3.7110699039834443
" "i am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly. 2.828681545869463
" "good heavens ! " cried elizabeth ; "but how could that be ? how could his will be disregarded ? why did not you seek legal redress ? " "there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. 3.9616894516925405
" "yes , vanity is a weakness indeed. 3.098435907370424
she had ventured only one glance at darcy. 3.152582523050063
i have done with you from this very day. 3.5809377798298083
" her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth. 3.492857931572091
amongst the most violent against him was Mrs bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters. 3.7765864928524038
i must beg to return to the house. 2.8484382930131953
Mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it. 2.7893713698744897
"i began to be afraid you would never come back again. 3.741876056569618
" "it is amazing to me , " said bingley , "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are. 3.834294949036086
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield. 3.6455364209448406
"the first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , "is never more to be in company with either of them. 3.9409614933165784
when Mr bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn. 3.587389726656581
we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice. 3.28080466430995
Mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker. 3.7075505289244366
" "my dear jane ! " exclaimed elizabeth , "you are too good. 3.100174735459146
" "i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. 2.850266627253845

" her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained. 3.311096729278567
their situation was awkward enough ; but her ' s she thought was still worse. 3.384224879128477
colonel fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman. 3.1837542609965386
each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Mr darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr bingley 's friend , without being heard by either of them. 4.255993460009951

the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten. 3.6071052282821663
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness. 3.7937768896464994
elizabeth 's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more. 3.6127191319961978
they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited. 3.217502419447877
" she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted. 4.052831012245615

from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr collins 's side , and as many bows on sir william 's , they departed. 4.307585278013536
wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say , three very silly sisters. 3.5448180046458
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent. 3.740715528643778
imprudent as a marriage between Mr wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland. 3.15076739218542
against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow Mr bingley 's carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made. 3.8298591404653206
" "their conduct has been such , " replied elizabeth , "as neither you , nor i , nor any body , can ever forget. 3.3141077532964056

" "oh ! hang kitty ! what has she to do with it ? come be quick , be quick ! where is your sash my dear ? " but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters. 3.2161344354516976
they solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister. 3.426733706244092
" "but why all this secrecy ? why any fear of detection ? why must their marriage be private ? oh ! no , no , this is not likely. 3.1676936915266283
" elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances. 3.4403038559436676
their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy 's. 3.960105869832215
let her go then. 4.002218811207924
" "i think i have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in meryton. 3.1669444908406077
Mrs bennet 's best comfort was , that Mr bingley must be down again in the summer. 3.2724419373989067
" " my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , eliza , " said charlotte. 4.189812869651725
i never was. 3.6190751325677772
when a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty. 3.398238951300665
are the others coming out ? " "i do not know. 3.449527959053705
" "and do you really know all this ? " cried Mrs gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive. 3.4127462204024024
miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful. 3.850086287446515
Mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride. 3.3289260560241534
" "did you go by the village of kympton ? " "i do not recollect that we did. 3.3363026736464967
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and i am sure if i had been you , i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it. 3.746744603318664
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy. 3.2633790395820554
"oh ! dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain. 3.597414139407441
he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all. 4.187541765493519
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable. 3.292573614221638
" "exceed their income ! my dear Mr bennet , " cried his wife , "what are you talking of ? why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more. 3.0251828733558495
i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. 3.7840672798341917
but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be wisest ; and now , i hope you are satisfied. 3.5587923924318026
his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Mr wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited. 3.281675334096855
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns. 3.154471610670814
you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself. 4.367452490358464
as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out. 3.878424279578843
" bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business. 3.4761238772013447
" "but you forget , mama , " said elizabeth , "that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs long has promised to introduce him. 3.646898374761535
"i wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer. 4.088723677751857
he was received by Mrs bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend. 3.691353520788106
his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! oh ! it must be my uncle 's doings ! generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself. 3.32031912883015
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. 3.4950795301429745
lady catherine 's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts. 3.26427849270784
the letter was to this effect : "my dear lizzy , "i wish you joy. 3.3620614396759443
" "miss eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , "despises cards. 3.347148928825624
i know your disposition , lizzy. 3.4331588092314536
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt 's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over. 3.779162061692579
" "and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " "my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle 's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour. 3.332927566797934
it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention. 3.8057127628800878
Mr hurst looked at her with astonishment. 3.2893803210561154
"from what we have seen of him , " continued Mrs gardiner , "i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham. 3.87569224564127
my father bears it better. 3.4557798588999717
" "indeed i could not. 3.893500935089344
Mrs gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs bennet and Mrs philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces. 3.4597977079164433
" "dear lizzy ! " "oh ! you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general. 4.1284076031329136
her brother 's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. 3.7080993654497356
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer. 3.9394479044313213
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion. 3.8726861337313196
Mr collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. 3.0735314355740764
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! " "i am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied sir william , "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. 3.5137934540893525
he cannot afford it. 3.4094854246353092
his letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution. 4.222330349143188
sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. 4.114756287591988
soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately. 3.7352725669009037
the world has been deceived in that respect ; and i am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune. 3.374022841998327
but the case is this. 3.6334892841778075
he was well , but so much engaged with Mr darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him. 4.164335076062811
bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept. 3.586026868409327
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more i think than last year. 3.3616498130773262
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers. 3.6186069239515213
she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down. 3.8395186957168814
i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. 3.431607676082636
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , i dare say. 3.0384818394685933
" jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern. 3.1919774949956707
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw. 3.165387724842596
"what an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut. 3.475657789536301
your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done. 3.4719906676453105
Number. 2.239615789728809
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father. 3.486515552228454
both changed colour , one looked white , the other red. 3.500900370118457
in a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost. 3.47053328693622
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr bennet were dead. 3.653518815071792
"they are going to be encamped near brighton ; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all. 4.121009920928739
you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and Mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. 3.750870977487349
you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much. 3.8197827549013637
her fellow travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable. 3.867339688072441
" "you cannot be too much on your guard. 3.2015282546449684
there can be no love in all this. 3.412632478838286
and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married. 3.309632795263882
it originated in Mrs gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth 's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband 's. 3.9642742164636573
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ; and Mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings. 3.580105055853401
" at that moment they were met from another walk , by Mrs hurst and elizabeth herself. 3.64890829151157
elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it. 3.2089708380019974
her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness. 3.734065698422047
he carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear. 3.9509683252298173
he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. 4.069973725015581
"yes , ma 'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor. 4.149154690865652
" the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. 4.043925133801665
"you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! unfeeling , selfish girl ! do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? " "lady catherine , i have nothing farther to say. 3.7065725286084383
my good opinion once lost is lost for ever. 2.9468681225912476
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. 3.559692028276707
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers. 3.339860357353917
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham 's departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. 3.3499278205656124
" "beyond a doubt , they do wish him to chuse miss darcy , " replied jane ; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. 3.667146089349352
" "so much the better. 2.3157733978021864
" "my motive for cautioning you , is as follows. 3.656681514850555
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday. 3.3618882808109665
" "indeed ! " "yes the late Mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. 3.4705729156580643
i have suspected it some time , but i am now convinced. 4.073539064522293
"yes if darcy does not put it off again. 3.4208220916873597
wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her. 4.030565016868244
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above. 3.783688402896962
"well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , "i have no more to say. 3.4931710602445194
"i am trying to make it out. 3.0492354977523233

there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. 3.7179875709710712
the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation. 3.3477986842640104
" "i never can be thankful , Mr bennet , for any thing about the entail. 3.7390874779239227
the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty seven , was elizabeth 's intimate friend. 3.5013324801916434
but she had no reason to fear Mr and Mrs gardiner 's curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication. 3.4979994081117862
"it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , "but at the same time , Mr bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. 3.925907723167572
i roused , and interested you , because i was so unlike them. 3.687748044187619

he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. 3.87046546154568
Mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do. 3.181647864649648
it is highly improper. 3.3632419115538323

"lizzy , you must not do so. 4.2066505954819196
are you much acquainted with Mr darcy ? " "as much as i ever wish to be , " cried elizabeth warmly , - "i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable. 3.9512587769572955
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther. 4.1100474453811
" "miss elizabeth bennet ! " repeated miss bingley. 3.385896557811491
i know not what to think. 2.437521514020804
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr bingley and jane , she had never doubted ; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. 3.755328182428613
you must send john with the young ladies , Mrs collins. 3.619868410118412
the suspicions which had just arisen of Mr darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. 3.4075745272833706
" lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , "the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. 3.3243675807949216
it is useless to talk of it. 3.2659198637895526

" "what do you mean , hill ? we have heard nothing from town. 2.8191691623851316
" "oh , yes. 2.9819164445811333
could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ? Mr darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! it is admirable ! " elizabeth tried to join in her father 's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile. 3.7667028690840043
as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , "this is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of. 3.3671453135775735
Mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth , "i am glad you are come back , lizzy. 2.986070933858454
among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. 4.774595514312158
" elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved. 3.32464334895509
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship 's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give. 3.758728564951922

Mr bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house. 3.4054089351761836
till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happiness. 3.678572117244764
" "i am sick of Mr bingley , " cried his wife. 3.6258831161044474
i came to you without a doubt of my reception. 3.2838724910046775
Mrs gardiner abused her stupidity. 3.455303518397845
but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife. 3.200280085071684
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them. 3.5684017170597357

we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb. 4.543833663237067
" Mr darcy 's letter to lady catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what Mr bennet sent to Mr collins , in reply to his last. 3.6105221409097754
our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly. 3.5016414901460493
but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible. 3.4381168934722917
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ; but at last on Mrs bennet 's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , "oh ! that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. 3.430030449106758
"my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table. 3.452190501422799
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton. 2.8625253177668495

elizabeth felt jane 's pleasure. 3.780428243063551
the commendation bestowed on him by Mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature. 3.3273705101276123
but that gentleman , " looking at darcy , "seemed to think the country was nothing at all. 3.609524555970939
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. 3.5376658859239836
bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever. 3.235438482013138
their reception at home was most kind. 3.5709892934817513
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. 3.2365428731827603
" "lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now. 3.4860426407825966
he leaves out half his words , and blots the rest. 4.310325677757841
"come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared. 3.842474670048109
they met several times , for there was much to be discussed. 3.7527140791408122
in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off. 4.666542648027831
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. 2.8904967185914403

my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me. 3.479291379455657
" "i mention it , because it is the living which i ought to have had. 3.75679458409769
" as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , "i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. 4.050596486116607
my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman 's education. 3.9104688043332314
they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable. 4.438573486207021
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there. 4.200852153905517
Mr wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia. 3.1829246229054635
he merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention. 3.303323945073777
" lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , "i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit. 3.463502991175404
as no objection was made to the young people 's engagement with their aunt , and all Mr collins 's scruples of leaving Mr and Mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that Mr wickham had accepted their uncle 's invitation , and was then in the house. 3.8379791694567618
" "she is a very fine looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well. 3.2984517014047214
but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it. 3.9991432006865346
Mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton. 3.226603199710058
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter. 3.9844027023213924
she was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother 's manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness. 4.0793195221268315
" she replied in the affirmative. 3.60475992867099
"how good it was in you , my dear Mr bennet ! but i knew i should persuade you at last. 3.953378331200858
i will put on my things in a moment. 3.1247739481396124
if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all. 3.918128321985475
her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for Mr gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little. 3.838172495703571
with a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. 3.513503316338536

he could not speak a word for full ten minutes. 3.482213040619359
such i was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth ! what do i not owe you ! you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous. 3.333858259271653
" "and of your infliction , " cried elizabeth with energy. 4.338116821879222
for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. 4.099196735745718
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it. 3.966575306494917
at present i will say nothing about it. 2.6590227960786814
your 's , &c. 2.2705568773205105
Mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character. 3.47498750236115
and when i returned home , the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight 's time. 3.3548021872639717
" elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet. 2.852211667678386
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after. 3.8071198621633866
when i last saw her , she was not very promising. 4.006136163251616

" "i beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think. 2.3487097162657977
his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother 's reproach prevented his feeling any regret. 4.225166534499878
the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. 3.355468559195318
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it. 3.5475474549418693
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love. 3.8065697338487623
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess. 3.5235614362155165
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter. 2.7698485614150465
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane. 3.3747365052369003
elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect. 3.507702866959738
Mr bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. 3.47624044199483
the day passed much as the day before had done. 3.5225191703264636
" and when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , "oh ! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh , i think it will be very tolerable. 4.520849099241247
"but what is to be done about pemberley ? " cried Mrs gardiner. 3.84997164242364
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more. 3.470800649274823
" "if it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ; but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine. 3.6504152758322914
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son inlaw , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion. 3.6114452539861106
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair. 3.4282763606822075
"tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley 's. 4.0460668744446995
" "in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. 3.29657262348294
at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , "how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book ! when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library. 3.7950910681920957

" "and i certainly never shall give it. 2.885301118734963
bingley met them with hopes that Mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected. 3.462129219922198
" Mr wickham 's attention was caught ; and after observing Mr collins for a few moments , he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh. 3.167470978598052
i knew how it would be. 3.3701210993968576

the dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing. 3.2211889675682297
when the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist. 3.367665854293594
about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement. 3.7540774563624657
by supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy. 3.319502440464099
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i particularly begged him to do. 4.515851102311083
if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. 4.20785425683053
" "it will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said miss lucas. 3.8489201272625277

what a delightful library you have at pemberley , Mr darcy ! " "it ought to be good , " he replied , "it has been the work of many generations. 3.752610705469915
he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air gloomy. 4.055445704211803

"your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds. 3.5129285689099587
that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Mr bingley , was incomprehensible. 4.061258487915055

" "there is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , i shall not be the person to discourage him. 3.662569763032229
one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth , "lizzy , i never gave you an account of my wedding , i believe. 3.7392075476089595
but i will no longer importune my young cousin. 3.2465169782219814
"that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance. 3.498801808244528
i had not an idea of it. 3.3726785557417

and poor Mr darcy ! dear lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered. 3.85828709944511
to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about Mr robinson. 3.093312223197576
" "we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , " said elizabeth. 3.083897094018957
butgood lord ! how unlucky ! there is not a bit of fish to be got to day. 4.004619455524724
on the gentlemen 's appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance. 3.2752445198349784
this information , however , startled Mrs bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so. 3.9891482568189813
he drew a chair near her. 3.5962673281453106

and if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london , for i am going there early in june , for a week ; and as dawson does not object to the barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , i should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large. 4.065833941517168
but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr darcy walk into the room. 3.4720918982696745
Mrs bennet said only , "nonsense , nonsense ! " "what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? " cried he. 3.80467908176144
i knew that Mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman. 4.026708142680744

elizabeth 's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another. 3.139091691221072

lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father 's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter. 4.110236540640879

when the ladies returned to the drawing room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted. 3.9319447630586923
elizabeth was delighted. 3.6697692593369546
but if i go on , i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem. 3.539146525100134
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself. 3.842165494700174
he was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , "i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , ' she a beauty ! i should as soon call her mother a wit. 3.8677639287546794
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , i shall not say nay to him ; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william 's in his regimentals. 3.304254612862699
lady catherine rose also , and they turned back. 4.183936310584786

" she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , "oh ! Mr bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar. 3.830949798163374
"how strange this is ! and for this we are to be thankful. 3.43043432823555

Mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets. 3.307702813798433
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life. 3.7040754726320197
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth 's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. 3.333403653999063
miss darcy , on her brother 's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side. 4.059420528838788

i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up. 3.7700668809111697
" "certainly not ; at first. 3.226336727874741
i do not know who is good enough for him. 2.8631383281562046
i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood. 3.907947301645946
her ladyship was highly incensed. 3.376271695589466
" vol. 2.8975504753139045
it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast. 3.3211489579699682
they gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound. 3.788664833281756
" while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning. 3.231527789417615
after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses. 3.956536915404157
let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay. 4.165676276417163
lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband 's regiment happens to be so far off. 3.539103910731725
"he meant , i believe , " replied jane , "to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them. 3.619303461440264
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother 's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? catherine , weak spirited , irritable , and completely under lydia 's guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and lydia , self willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing. 3.6221998727739804
you must learn some of my philosophy. 3.2714367938883973
" "my object then , " replied darcy , "was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past ; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. 3.8709513283789065
" miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour. 4.044287043820129
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. 3.2771647224359532
" the colour now rushed into elizabeth 's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , "you look conscious. 3.4903892439522193
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me. 3.6433976207115157
Mrs collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine 's being rather displeased by her staying at home. 3.7272811852793177
" she found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , "i think i have understood that Mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ? " "i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future. 3.5872637722007235
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again. 3.4445128983540125
his revenge would have been complete indeed. 4.003477268158831
the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words. 3.5757470191239635
and i think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece 's. 3.3579444668972944
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance. 3.3473926495987136
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. 2.9231969099528015
lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention. 4.132454306994151
but we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride. 4.024301369681839
here , sarah , come to miss bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown. 4.077099639218164
as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. 3.470868082178729
" "your attendance upon her , has been too much for you. 3.650017287187761
however , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were. 4.640910520232858
i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point. 2.962856895794961
people did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true. 4.827653681810429
" " Mr collins moreover adds , " "i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known. 3.4819165245727306
there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable. 3.8321910494246763
" elizabeth quietly answered "undoubtedly ; " and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family. 3.12944277479448
he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again. 4.066681033895977
"lady catherine de bourgh , " she replied , "has very lately given him a living. 3.5150923058778614
a house in town ! every thing that is charming ! three daughters married ! ten thousand a year ! oh , lord ! what will become of me. 3.1870391634031283
" elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her. 3.3478558354134154
" miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. 3.0305174543746207
Mr collins 's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs bennet. 3.341507193163276
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer. 3.679048370404623
lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house. 4.000294763642036
if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen. 4.330868475130464
Mrs bennet 's schemes for this day were ineffectual. 3.3252212829899683
"on the evening before my going to london , " said he "i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago. 3.7375976037252165
" "true , " said Mr bennet , "but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it. 3.719562636422141
at such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented. 3.598634213492298
he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions. 4.11986032986299
Number. 2.239615789728809
" "i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object. 3.5046470732966033
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. 3.142400470403823
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within. 4.492035475537714
"do not you want to know who has taken it ? " cried his wife impatiently. 3.85702447150634
this cannot be ! engaged to Mr darcy ! no , no , you shall not deceive me. 3.7472586671841466
i knew you would be wishing me joy. 3.368343628823386
he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. 3.6341710344708615
if you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation. 3.2124942130428424
elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between Mr wickham and herself. 3.3925773170686204
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case. 3.4896251404923997
she has known him only a fortnight. 3.3267090932880508
" upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock. 3.295911287732446
good heaven ! brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton. 4.144050077461525
the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch. 3.6879401892097827
the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte 's dying an old maid. 3.247163630591743
but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure. 3.874399230193826
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. 3.2419395156438506
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more. 3.4140761589927804
in a few minutes , Mrs bennet half opened the door and called out , "lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you. 3.443868905790479
" he then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. 4.024066724428925
you thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say. 3.5448408234679234
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. 2.784074018760154
Mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house. 3.3084506675213814
she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , "now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let Mr collins and me have a little conversation together. 4.126192959561109
Mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public. 3.453010090160625
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained. 3.8299912581912006
her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. 3.177992609398493
i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother. 3.8605743337353235
they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. 3.471360498998353
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. 3.265155353672945
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , gossiping lucases. 3.5574073369350288
" "why did not you all learn ? you ought all to have learned. 3.389931524758662
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; jane certainly could not come back. 3.2230270282262037
i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that Mr darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. 3.91759335284914
it was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit. 3.7475795563888505
" Mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters. 3.018184235472157
" "will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again ? at present i have not room to do them justice. 3.3678313471434063
to Mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough. 3.736312334375726
his reception however was of the most flattering kind. 3.8483870318813005
" "yes , madam , " said Mrs bennet , delighted to speak to a lady catherine. 3.526266693107798
Number. 2.239615789728809
elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley. 3.547760253175432
"i have no reason , i assure you , " said he , "to be dissatisfied with my reception. 3.1697994605233215
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? " elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , "you are mistaken , Mr darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner. 3.262274893742526
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. 3.789485323802653
what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received ! he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex. 3.7610017903406874
i dearly love a laugh. 3.700711914654155
"the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other. 3.6410975240077454
" "you are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body ! if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers. 3.4021224657055558
i shall offer to pay him to morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter. 4.390446621789028
- i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you. 3.679834081627708
the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn. 3.8724781828135475
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men servants go with her. 3.1815153271564593
oh ! lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall i bear so much happiness ! " she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty. 3.785064268659883
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner 's shop just over the way. 3.1696267881528257
"it is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. 3.3445379212412596
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was. 4.054305885835499
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious. 3.862838877070595
she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend. 3.5055130409378705
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london ; and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys. 3.8507375977717166
" "but i was embarrassed. 3.0063680973047577
Mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure. 3.5868994279508377
" and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house. 3.2953521287109346
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have been left as printed. 4.049364210012848
" mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father 's speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good. 4.048264315926552
a few weeks , he believed. 3.5845678215203813
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject. 3.658088930005277
lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when Mr collins first came to hunsford. 3.743322870388427
"lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. 3.0589463843924545
" elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself. 3.1663114600579045
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do. 3.362874341296162
for my part , i am inclined to believe it all Mr darcy 's , but you shall do as you chuse. 4.056179295835693
lady catherine de bourgh 's attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable. 3.0721532130164957
at length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs reynolds replied , that he was , adding , "but we expect him to morrow , with a large party of friends. 3.665751040684323
i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her. 3.916353074424802
Mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield. 3.1542324962919572
i assure you , that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it. 3.4063733179121782
" * * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased Mrs bennet 's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject. 3.6160221892931443
but whatever may be the sentiments which Mr wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character. 3.1589626123991486
to the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr bingley 's , she could not make a very favourable answer. 3.8871716365248954
" "gracechurch street , monday , august Number. 3.324374974631282
the supposition did not pain her. 3.491944478506845
" "upon my word , sir , " cried elizabeth , "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration. 2.8554966218327134
he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably. 3.94342943542921
i guessed as much. 3.947880132445531
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible. 3.705594396280398
" "and i have another favour to ask. 2.981644656782964
to be sure london was rather thin , but however the little theatre was open. 3.309328827121189
but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. 3.3859955457314057
you know how i detest it , unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner. 3.7225820858494507
i hope they will not meet at all. 3.459589875285722
not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body. 3.2438354156131144
i did not expect such a compliment. 3.24966671537591
can i speak plainer ? do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart. 3.3953695267120465
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology , " "hunsford , " and "lady catherine de bourgh. 4.377878714234662
"i want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister 's , "what you have learnt about Mr wickham. 4.124901097919207
" elizabeth could not but look surprised. 2.7825053508534854
" "how hard it is in some cases to be believed ! " "and how impossible in others ! " "but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge ? " "that is a question which i hardly know how to answer. 2.9849264006162093
"i am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ? if i had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on him. 3.4846414795238285
when they were all in the drawing room , the questions which elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give. 3.5948385784716868
she asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother 's maiden name ? elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly. 3.6427489633422234
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast. 3.0933958587836665
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her. 3.536115163476662
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard. 3.465814988680221
had she found jane in any apparent danger , Mrs bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield. 3.6259665307218993
i am not equal to it. 3.4158324856414013
"and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over. 3.3404252683852875
i hope we may often meet again. 3.2997033718661224
