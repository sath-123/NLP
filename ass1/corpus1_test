" miss bennet still looked all amazement
 it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected

 elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man

 she followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly! "a man who has once been refused! how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!" she was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying, "is your sister at pemberley still?" "yes, she will remain there till christmas
 she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion

 jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again, elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys
 she wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise
 your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say to you
 the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met
 he bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr darcy, with an expression of half laughing alarm
 "well, lizzy," said Mrs bennet one day, "what is your opinion  now of this sad business of jane's? for my part, i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody
 had she not seen him in derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there  with his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it
" " that is a failing indeed!" cried elizabeth

 your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable
 it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance
 they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street

" "we are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply
 "good gracious! lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr darcy! who would have thought it! and is it really true? oh! my sweetest lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! what pin money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! jane's is nothing to it nothing at all

 but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?" "will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?" "by all means," cried bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of
" "your picture may be very exact, louisa," said bingley; "but this was all lost upon me
" charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time
" "i assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice
" after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying, "i am astonished at his intimacy with Mr bingley! how can Mr bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? how can they suit each other? do you know Mr bingley?" "not at all

" "i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him
 in her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin

 other schemes too came into her head
" and with these words he hastily left the room, and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house
 "can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated
 she could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended

 in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before

 but why Mr darcy came so often to the parsonage, it was more difficult to understand
 he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him, to lay his private actions open to the world

 "can it be possible that he will marry her?" "wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her sister

 she dreaded seeing wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible
 "you used us abominably ill," answered Mrs hurst, "in running away without telling us that you were coming out

 "and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! oh, that i knew how it was!" but wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour
 she saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers
" "i have no right to give  my opinion," said wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise
 was not a man to be trusted
" elizabeth almost stared at her
 perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me
 teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! no, no i feel he may defy us there
 it is highly improper
 you are to understand, miss bennet, that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will i be dissuaded from it
 mary and kitty were both with Mrs bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all
 you have a sweet room here, Mr bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk

" "oh, no!" said elizabeth
 it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling
 though lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr and Mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected
 you could not make  me happy, and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make  you so
 her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming
 with such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr wickham and the officers, Mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin
 their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge
 all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light
 "believe me, my dear miss elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections
 she had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years
 he really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger
" "she seems a very pleasant young woman," said bingley
 what shall we do with him? lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in bingley's way
 she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion of her
 i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it; i believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as i wished it in reason
" "that is exactly what i should have supposed of you," said elizabeth
 what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? as a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship! how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! how much of good or evil must be done by him! every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression
e
 he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way
 elizabeth was in agonies
 a house in town! every thing that is charming! three daughters married! ten thousand a year! oh, lord! what will become of me
" "do let us have a little music," cried miss bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share
 the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from lady catherine
" he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away
 i saw them the night before last
 it makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else
 chapter xv
 but, my dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of  your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend
 certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as i was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it
" "i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful
 if your abhorrence of  me should make  my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning

 let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance
 her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill judged thing in the world! how strange must it appear to him! in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! oh! why did she come? or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage

" "an excellent consolation in its way," said elizabeth, "but it will not do for  us
 it settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts
 Mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well
 the wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this
 "oh! she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld! but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i dare say, very agreeable
 she looked at jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns
 he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity
 "oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately
" from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr darcy had been over rated, elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs gardiner's long letter, but now, having  that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: "i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, i was too cross to write
" "his pride," said miss lucas, "does not offend  me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it
 i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you
 he  spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security
 there was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning
 they had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about
" "i am afraid you do not like your pen
" "i should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother
 as he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer
 but Mrs bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which would exactly finish jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before
 she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who often joined them, and good naturedly engaged Mr collins's conversation to herself
 she told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous
" elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop, or lady catherine de bourgh, by venturing to dance
 as a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement
" "are they indeed?" cried elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction
 attention, forbearance, patience with darcy, was injury to wickham
 my sister, i am sure, will not hear of her removal
 if you are a good girl for the next ten years, i will take you to a review at the end of them
 besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the  shire have left meryton, and they are going in a fortnight
 the more i see of the world, the more am i dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense
" darcy mentioned his letter
" elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to colonel fitzwilliam, "your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word i say
 if she heard me, it was by good luck, for i am sure she did not listen
 "he has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! i had not believed it possible
 vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?" Mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply, "do not make yourself uneasy, my love
 for my part, i am inclined to believe it all Mr darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse
 she had a sister married to a Mr philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade
" elizabeth longed to observe that Mr bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself
 without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment
" but jane could think with certainty on only one point, that Mr bingley, if he  had  been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public
 bingley was the principal spokesman, and miss bennet the principal object
 i am going away myself
 she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs
 she was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more
 he is the kind of man, indeed, to whom i should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask
 i can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,  i have seen nothing of it
 but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment
 wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in london, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her
" " you go to brighton! i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds! no, kitty, i have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it
" "i deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried elizabeth; "i am  not a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things
 "only think of its being three months," she cried, "since i went away; it seems but a fortnight i declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time
 how shall we punish him for such a speech?" "nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said elizabeth
 i knew that Mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman
 sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance
 but i have always observed, that they who are good natured when children, are good natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest tempered, most generous hearted, boy in the world
 a person may be proud without being vain
 miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other
" miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection
" "i do, i do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "i love him
 he and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london
 but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley
 Mr hurst and Mr bingley were at piquet, and Mrs hurst was observing their game
 neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject
 i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies
 why jane you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see Mr bingley
" elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry  her, had she been his relation
 the conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport
 though Mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage
" "you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate
" "i hope not so
 it was unpardonable
 "Mr collins," said she, "speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, i suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman
" she then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two
 with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal
 their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr and Mrs gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner at pemberley, before they left the country
" "this account then is what he has received from Mr darcy
 i must speak to hill, this moment
 all this was acknowledged to Mrs gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:-"i am now convinced, my dear aunt, that i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion, i should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil
 she now lost every expectation of pleasure
 they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable
" "and of your infliction," cried elizabeth with energy
 it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day
 but i am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me! they were excessively sorry to go! but so they always are
 he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband
 Mrs bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces
 whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr collins, was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr bennet were dead
 Mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public
 she saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once
 elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to miss darcy, without calling her attention
 they were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs bennet and kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what elizabeth felt
 he addressed himself directly to miss bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley's salutation

" "yes, very different
 he  was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey
 nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though i am sure (and i do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole
 he did not leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a gentleman had called on business
 on the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance
 no man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it
 Mrs bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could
 it is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, i hope you will think of us
 she was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle

 "i know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things, and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object
 she could not think of darcy's leaving kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him
 from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink
 there is one point, on which i want your advice
 lady catherine's great attentions to Mrs collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent
" "that is to say, you had given your permission
 well, i was so frightened i did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day
 you know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends
 "two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge
" "in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either

 i was very uncomfortable, i may say unhappy
 "it is nothing in comparison of rosings, my lady, i dare say; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's

" "how i long to see her again! i never met with anybody who delighted me so much
 the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to Mr collins
 the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and wickham, who happened to sit near elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies
 lydia the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern
 she enquired into charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry
 lady catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to darcy, "miss bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a london master
 elizabeth looked expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know i am married to day? i was afraid they might not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle, so i was determined he should know it, and so i let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then i bowed and smiled like any thing

 the rain continued the whole evening without intermission; jane certainly could not come back
 would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress
 it was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till easter day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening
" "my manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally i assure you
 who  could about such a nasty little freckled thing?" elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of  expression herself, the coarseness of the  sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal! as soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and lydia's purchases, were seated in it
 she opened the door, and met maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out, "oh, my dear eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining room, for there is such a sight to be seen! i will not tell you what it is
 you are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income
 these bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had i with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by every thing
 but don't imagine it was from any silly cause
 i did not know before, that i had  two daughters on the brink of matrimony
 Mr bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters
 i do not know who is good enough for him
 it should not be said, that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers
 his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret
 while settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her
" "and quite alone? have all her friends left her?" "Mrs annesley is with her
" elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word
 Mr wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could
 oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him
" "poor wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner
 "and they are really to be married!" cried elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves
 on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects

 i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are packed up
 her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered
 i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr darcy

 i promised them so faithfully! what will wickham say? it was to be such a secret!" "if it was to be secret," said jane, "say not another word on the subject

 "what a letter is this, to be written at such a moment
 elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane, while Mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor
 a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved
 i depend on you for that
" "my dear, you flatter me
" "i can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either
" "certainly
 elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself

" "complied with! i am only ashamed of his asking so little
" this was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas
 elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been

 miss bennet, i insist on being satisfied
" elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply
 i am not qualified to form one
 but the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son inlaw, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion
 they called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt
 she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances: and to have Mr collins instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed
 miss bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening  she was his settled choice
 the suspicions which had just arisen of Mr darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love

 she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal
 it was kindly meant
 when the party broke up, lydia returned with Mrs forster to meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning
 those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs forster called her, and they were going to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public
 they followed her into the dining parlour
 such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house
 elizabeth was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes
" "this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west
 in spite of her deeply rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger
 the part which i acted, is now to be explained
" "you need not distress yourself
 she looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend
 but she is nothing to me now
 the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more i think than last year
 he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from  that, i am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before
 having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business
 Mr collins then returned to elizabeth
 is it true?" elizabeth replied that it was
 as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters
 "there has been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way
 "good heaven! what is to become of us! what are we to do!" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe
" "dear madam," cried Mrs hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr gardiner? he has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter
" "for heaven's sake, madam, speak lower
-"i certainly saw Mr darcy speaking to her
 i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford
 console lady catherine as well as you can
 "while i can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough
 this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given
Number through Number
 but these things happen so often! a young man, such as you describe Mr bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent
" elizabeth could not but look surprised
 my father supported him at school, and afterwards at cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education
 you tear them to pieces
" they were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good humoured smile, "come, Mr wickham, we are brother and sister, you know
 you must and shall be married by a special licence
 under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief
 the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each
 but the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name
 consider how important every moment is, in such a case
 what a delightful library you have at pemberley, Mr darcy!" "it ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations
 i certainly  have had my share of beauty, but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now
 "do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular

 in another minute Mr bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend
 i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior
 when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do
 he could not speak a word for full ten minutes
" " that will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on  me
 "you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age
 and with no one to speak to, of what i felt, no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had! oh! how i wanted you!" "how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to Mr darcy, for now they  do appear wholly undeserved
" "they have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters
 they have each their advantages, and i can be equally happy in either
" "i cannot pretend to be sorry," said wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with  him i believe it does not often happen
 you must not suspect me
 "lady catherine de bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living
" "when i wrote that letter," replied darcy, "i believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit
 having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity

 but, lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it
 jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way
 now, seriously, what have you ever known of self denial and dependence? when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?" "these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature
 she had gained her point, and had time to consider of it
 she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out
 how you must have hated me after  that evening?" "hate you! i was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction
 he spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided
" "yes; but he seemed to like his second better
 his coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and i wonder how he could presume to do it
 in ran Mrs bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out, "my dear jane, make haste and hurry down
-"i, who have prided myself on my discernment! i, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust
" "your surprise could not be greater than  mine in being noticed by you
" "i believe her to be both in a great degree," replied wickham; "i have not seen her for many years, but i very well remember that i never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent
 elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her
 he arranges the business just as he pleases
 colonel fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman
 that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr bingley and jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them
 she was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition
 by Mrs hurst and miss bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments
 the rest of the evening passed with the  appearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again
 don't think me angry, however, for i only mean to let you know, that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on  your side
 what did colonel forster say? had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place? they must have seen them together for ever
 thank god! i have not  that pain
 are you going much farther?" "no, i should have turned in a moment
 his doing so drew her notice
 if, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's, i can only say that i am sorry
 she received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice
 but on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away
" occupied in observing Mr bingley's attentions to her sister, elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend
 his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure
 upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward
 how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine
 had she merely  dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal
 she read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes
 instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as elizabeth half expected Mr bingley to do, he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's visit
 she answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "when you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance
" "i am talking of possibilities, charles
 "why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?" she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure
 but this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr darcy walk into the room
 [illustration: morning dress
 her ease and good spirits increased
" "my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents
 people  did say, you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but, however, i hope it is not true
 any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have been left as printed
 five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs bennet, for many years after lydia's birth, had been certain that he would
" jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern
" "of whom does jane ever think ill? and who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? but jane knows, as well as i do, what wickham really is
 it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure

 she certainly did not hate him
" she replied in the affirmative
 i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of whom we shall deprive you
 james's, sir william was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look
 she assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her
 dearest lizzy, i hardly know what i would write, but i have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed
 and his behaviour, so strikingly altered, what could it mean? that he should even speak to her was amazing! but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting
" "not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise
 at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration
" he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend
 but i will not repine
 it cannot be done too much; and when i next write to her, i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account
" "oh! yes," said elizabeth  drily"Mr darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him
 i shall offer to pay him to morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter
 "there  is something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming
 if, indeed, it should be so! but i dare not hope it
s
 she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation
 while she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes
 the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family
" "oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!" "perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister
 seriously, i would have you be on your guard
 after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?" "and we mean to treat you all," added lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there
 "do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain
 she practises very constantly
 no sooner did he appear, than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room
 Mr collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family
 to my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men
 the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball and at this ball, what do you think he did? he danced only four dances! i am sorry to pain you but so it was
" "that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline," cried her  brother"because he does  not write with ease
 they gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound

 he was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother inlaw, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could
 darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure
" "when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had no reason, i suppose, to believe them fond of each other
 you are not going to be  missish, i hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report
" "care of him! yes, i really believe darcy  does take care of him in those points where he most wants care
 elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more
 Mr darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them
 but it is all, all too late now
 i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on
 the apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts
 even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away

 Mr philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before
-"you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this
 "i often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends
 "for my own part," she rejoined, "i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her
" "pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried Mr collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state
" "but not before they went to brighton?" "no, i believe not
 such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr bingley's continued absence
 let her go then
 it was all pride and insolence
 the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable
 she looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest mary should be singing all night
 darcy took up a book; miss bingley did the same; and Mrs hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss bennet
 pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us
 i rather wonder now at your knowing  any
 you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken
" "no governess! how was that possible? five daughters brought up at home without a governess! i never heard of such a thing
 the recollection of what i then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me
" the tumult of elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation
 he was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again
 from something that he told me in our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him
 it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man
" "i dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age
 elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply
 the moment of her release from him was ecstacy
 my father bears it better
 in comparing her recollection of pemberley, with the minute description which wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself
 within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate
 the possibility of meeting Mr darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred
