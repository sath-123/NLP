he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. 2.5768860446667037
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town , where the family did not visit. 2.0789315494599885
you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters. 2.1462294963147683

"oh ! my dear father , " she cried , "come back , and write immediately. 2.3391904927817437
i was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Mr darcy. 2.0079639403240823
"this is an evening of wonders , indeed ! and so , darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow 's debts , and got him his commission ! so much the better. 1.8299930861122837
in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam. 2.025228368568497

it cannot be concealed from any one. 2.621078549111292
to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point. 3.3526195432465458

" their party in the dining room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them ; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger miss lucases ; and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person 's , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her. 2.471004902779674

" "upon my word , " said her ladyship , "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. 2.058357143236556
" elizabeth replied very concisely that she was. 2.96924995870575
" "and yours , " he replied with a smile , "is wilfully to misunderstand them. 2.611607549540628
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished. 3.215304218167659
" "i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ; but i always speak what i think. 2.3338098784745744
Mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. 2.1997286697664302
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , "oh ! mamma , do the people here abouts know i am married to day ? i was afraid they might not ; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like any thing. 2.034485546261857
they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to. 1.9703977827739874

there could not exist in the world two men , over whom Mr darcy could have such boundless influence. 2.5211123079411024
this room was my late master 's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. 2.5740998436424145
when the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time. 2.6457317699871847
after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr and Mrs gardiner , though unknown. 2.3649465937563168
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. 2.005306348455772
" "thank you , " said lydia , "for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry. 2.770695032862858
" "i am sure i know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this. 2.266829975176969

" "you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society ; and indeed i am quite of your opinion. 1.9256466822308937
this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it. 2.0597809941321135
pray , what is your age ? " "with three younger sisters grown up , " replied elizabeth smiling , "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it. 1.9431128343913815
you do not look well. 2.8914632049893
his most particular friend , you see by jane 's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. 2.606491577287459
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth 's performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste. 1.9900673241029063

" she held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house. 2.237655502784863
chapter xvi. 2.8498535182967997
" this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage. 2.486333655536724
at length , however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs reynolds replied , that he was , adding , "but we expect him to morrow , with a large party of friends. 2.2462765717097266
it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go. 2.0114946196315295
" "no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did. 3.0885729743081285
"my dear , dear lizzy , i would i do congratulate you but are you certain ? forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? " "there can be no doubt of that. 2.7228599539412435
"how good it was in you , my dear Mr bennet ! but i knew i should persuade you at last. 2.4085636344884405
" "i never can be thankful , Mr bennet , for any thing about the entail. 2.461934532330342
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure. 2.6677414007755047
" "good god ! what is the matter ? " cried he , with more feeling than politeness ; then recollecting himself , "i will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr and Mrs gardiner. 1.908787739726095
their sister 's wedding day arrived ; and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. 2.1698135606533033
and you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner. 1.9709526787939384
- i talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples. 2.466614590341196
but Mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. 1.675898137769066
lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , "i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern. 2.3126357108211852
it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane 's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. 2.1751358213116987
" "there is , i believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome. 1.818337543804858
"my dearest child , " she cried , "i can think of nothing else ! ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! 'tis as good as a lord ! and a special licence. 1.971526379498092
Mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. 1.9289888740322272

yes , miss bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. 2.3087843311160055
" "oh ! i am not at all afraid of her dying. 3.0549903119417814
" "i have not a doubt of Mr bingley 's sincerity , " said elizabeth warmly ; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. 2.777612110646572
when Mr bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure. 2.527791895491211
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceived again. 2.5538552529657874
" "removed ! " cried bingley. 3.549830099952806
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting. 2.384593900241138
that she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr darcy ! that he should have been in love with her for so many months ! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend 's marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. 2.958635115924548
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , i am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before. 2.4145646600252264
when the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist. 2.0432007319314396
" "and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason. 2.0721113881382394
" "yes , sir , i know i am. 3.1414353862866613
but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent. 3.2752420721311344
i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. 2.344877307290103

but i must write no more. 2.6707564435217317
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone. 2.0182465067759954
" "and if i had not a letter to write myself , i might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did. 2.3008632887284075

the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained. 2.6274192601390265
" "and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice. 2.075660835418287
" on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , "did not you think , Mr darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ? " "with great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic. 2.0831157953531845
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all. 1.9428443663780937

" "i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied. 2.7725372025405437
Mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield. 1.8242003641241187
she could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her question , and read on. 3.3457527782597993
i understand that Mr collins has made you an offer of marriage. 2.3470837634836736
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. 2.303008587797758

" " you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said Mr darcy , looking at the eldest miss bennet. 2.676250534723428
perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me. 2.2729643911224753
but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked. 2.159643838795628
but not long was the interval of tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company. 1.958713103816219
send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly. 2.2241642399104036
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him. 3.5531832723974275
elizabeth , on her side , had much to do. 2.615662368040964
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity. 1.984493589217344
" the idea of Mr collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : "my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish. 2.3723041387418236
now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ? when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? " "these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature. 1.6910747887347302
every body said how well she looked ; and Mr bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice. 1.9400239287299286
" Mrs collins , you must send a servant with them. 3.463348684016302
she blushed , and jane blushed ; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour. 2.1256761348737974
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria ; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone. 1.891661820382912

" Mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when Mr hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. 1.9128931985690873

Mrs long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not. 2.219760699431319

from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to Mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day. 1.9605001439991456

had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend 's permission , or being bold enough to come without it. 2.197852626826119
there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected. 2.0271153566188995
but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out. 2.2503919031125608

Mrs bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere. 2.1478773964636186
lady catherine rose also , and they turned back. 2.830404697287347

elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply. 2.3529342833369817
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship 's entrance , though no request of introduction had been made. 2.258453936024719
" "i believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied wickham ; "i have not seen her for many years , but i very well remember that i never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. 2.33944535241482
" "i beg your pardon. 2.4432896250016194
he had never had the slightest suspicion. 2.523304666606263
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them. 2.6846804365903414
the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first. 2.383894249642111
" Mr gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; Mrs reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister. 1.8280293523075075
the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Mr darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport. 2.0179748018828696
" "did Mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? " "i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady. 2.1744689801036277
"the first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , "is never more to be in company with either of them. 2.4247738105744614
i have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with. 2.0846978706677257
yet he knew to the contrary himself. 2.338838632575885
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield ; and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter. 2.505986035362929
first of all , he asked miss lucas. 3.2534650781954633
pardon me. 3.42355736552513
"now i am quite happy , " said she , "for you will be as happy as myself. 2.772379151123411
in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before. 2.4207071190447427
many stared. 3.414470997353168
forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante. 2.8935485003740125
four nieces of Mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that i recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her. 2.1771995007604605
" "you have only proved by this , " cried elizabeth , "that Mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. 2.3415659078516327
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care. 2.154560962856893
we acted with the best intentions. 2.377311205217777
at such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable. 2.6996782108596764
till this moment , i never knew myself. 2.7268579273237106
in spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation. 2.834676945458325
" "miss bennet , do you know who i am ? i have not been accustomed to such language as this. 2.3327529640170894
Mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet. 2.443736838094723
i hope he will overlook it. 2.961846109310622
nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece. 1.8813917623823744
" "whatever my connections may be , " said elizabeth , "if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you. 2.3046956916977073
i am impatient to see him. 2.889846973002337
he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom. 1.5392865625072396
i wonder what he can be doing there. 2.2563835533128738
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as i could. 2.0346305356487826
she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. 2.272131855718596
these causes must be stated , though briefly. 3.2892792188007585
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible ; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. 2.0674100377555726
"i see what you are feeling , " replied charlotte , - "you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr collins was wishing to marry you. 2.091990728531281
how humiliating is this discovery ! yet , how just a humiliation ! had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind. 2.243780000306122
i must confess myself surprised by your application ; i did not expect it from you. 2.0912628623907303
"then , who taught you ? who attended to you ? without a governess you must have been neglected. 2.2088243410571065
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Mr collins. 2.568975362308037
since the shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head. 2.568870488131442
the carriage was sent to meet them at - , and they were to return in it , by dinner time. 2.5753793079546767

"what do you mean , Mr bennet , by talking in this way ? you promised me to insist upon her marrying him. 2.105966836548319
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. 2.0198859381224192
we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. 1.7790544187412272
"oh ! my dear lydia , " she cried , "when shall we meet again ? " "oh , lord ! i don 't know. 2.1938272899424356
elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course. 1.8513191076203754

he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility. 2.033867532237841
Mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , "my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. 2.032912123395244
it is what every body says. 2.8244698791225855
bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and Mr bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on. 2.5031231606659996
" elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs. 2.0592184082886695
"oh , jane , take care. 2.780185859864611

bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. 2.0456717515871308
"do you prefer reading to cards ? " said he ; "that is rather singular. 2.166864357969047
i cannot find out that i hate her at all , or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. 2.4553249456123165
he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself. 2.267738643024324
my temper i dare not vouch for. 2.624273436745172
in the intervals of her discourse with Mrs collins , she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to Mrs collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl. 1.989256264726999

had the late Mr darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father 's uncommon attachment to me , irritated him i believe very early in life. 1.9914310303622447
" she could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success. 2.4108472279035444
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine. 2.6249072955679744
my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister 's partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman 's heart. 2.0643891411740865
she was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us. 3.2358696189414724

the comfort to her , of the regiment 's approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression. 2.4397050970232645
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture. 2.433102919458873

" " Mr collins moreover adds , " "i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known. 1.9701041540632622

" jane 's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall ; elizabeth was glad of it ; till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante. 2.295351927683192
but my dear lydia , i don 't at all like your going such a way off. 2.004209068442634

what he means to do , i am sure i know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening. 13.316503593422423
" " Mr bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? you take delight in vexing me. 2.535533428246599
" "i should like it beyond any thing ! " said her mother. 2.531884155157313
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! " "i am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied sir william , "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. 1.8754111667707891
you refuse , then , to oblige me. 2.5891546400941965
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related. 2.2111520371979765
i desire you will stay where you are. 2.403992051581342
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from thence to the library ; their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , "if you are looking for my master , ma 'am , he is walking towards the little copse. 2.0644662217889054
" she then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. 2.73876089661763
we dine at rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home. 2.0320262286707353
they then went away. 2.8981319976755398
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners. 2.271276706432421
had it been your uncle 's doing , i must and would have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. 2.4292848310332458
as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables. 1.9488998211750923
she had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle 's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance. 2.8547355274359196
elizabeth had settled it that Mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching pemberley ; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. 2.0629876729517633
there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter , which promises well. 2.4862596978030025
his fear of her , has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart. 2.5434776236850256
Mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire. 2.056287459504157
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour. 2.0234275881609283
"you look pale. 3.00767923101462
elizabeth silently attended her. 3.168163386325639
brother inlaw of wickham ! every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. 2.2517041580181933
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew 's letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. 2.501004573181789
the promised letter of thanks from Mr collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth 's abode in the family might have prompted. 1.9043003366265359
elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley. 2.0075366026383237
" to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female. 2.1913480563289713
when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when Mrs philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine 's drawing rooms , and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper 's room. 1.9906964016144788
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr darcy 's pleasure in the bingleys ' invitation to the officers ; and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant smile , "i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here. 2.039069289309953
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states. 1.930874609273856
" he listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long. 2.0389440244702226
from that moment i observed my friend 's behaviour attentively ; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him. 2.5192116061418623
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long. 2.5872143636402547
"oh ! lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! if i could but see you as happy ! if there were but such another man for you ! " "if you were to give me forty such men , i never could be so happy as you. 1.9078454892686032
" Mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand ; but in vain. 2.468555365782982
Mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcy 's delight , when she should enter the room. 2.4763907941959777
as for jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than elizabeth 's ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to. 2.7159237069361253
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. 2.651964261335193
Number. 2.2885629017403297
"i knew , " said he , "that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary. 2.492949806526962
" "the person of whom i speak , is a gentleman and a stranger. 2.3213338119857623
whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done gracefully. 2.961762389212477
the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. 1.9821267336468391
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune. 2.078031184857073
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless. 2.9220390081010854
when you told Mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? " "nay , " cried bingley , "this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. 2.052812251655482
Mrs collins will be very glad of your company , i am sure. 3.085535519964789
let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. 2.3748520815519814
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself. 2.5017459993124618
" "i dare say you believed it ; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. 2.5233799460093325
had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best ; but her sister 's was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself. 2.9975326423904707
" in darcy 's presence she dared not mention wickham 's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment 's distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. 2.3731773437011565
after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , "is not this nice ? is not this an agreeable surprise ? " "and we mean to treat you all , " added lydia ; "but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there. 1.685693290400042
f. 2.7701078899210225
he has given in all his debts ; i hope at least he has not deceived us. 2.053473015142373
i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. 2.1618308460279105
say that urgent business calls us home immediately. 2.3954100919950982
my dear lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us. 2.3283520511884053
see paragraph Number. 2.654345908326838
" "so much the better. 2.7337595254294977
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter 's lips instead of your own. 2.195812590216527
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not. 2.490030610733612
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country. 2.776375580669164
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained. 1.9695142244497588
he was full of joy and attention. 2.2689137616671187
elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word. 2.416704524455841
"if one could but go to brighton ! " observed Mrs bennet. 2.4471549831056847
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology , " "hunsford , " and "lady catherine de bourgh. 2.8028195067384996
when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him. 2.66110003163442
the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him. 2.1552374354085195
miss bingley 's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt. 2.2472654055219197
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg tm license as specified in paragraph Number. 2.2732433881800764
"pray do , my dear miss lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , "for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves. 2.1759780827373003
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew ; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce. 2.0258639320103504
jane resolutely kept her place at the table ; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw Mr darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister. 2.4380086619741195
it does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours. 1.8528020357075348
- "i certainly saw Mr darcy speaking to her. 2.9847414401483383
all connection between us seemed now dissolved. 2.2528174423732494
and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left meryton greatly in debt ; but i hope this may be false. 2.9265195102270467
"he has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , "by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! i had not believed it possible. 2.2555361747362737
you must learn some of my philosophy. 2.3050415499902326
" "i do not at all know ; but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield. 2.8415367646568206
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. 2.1035340576517125
when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. 2.69985141898743
" "you are uniformly charming ! " cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; "and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable. 1.955520564883454
it is from my cousin , Mr collins , who , when i am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases. 3.2023341104851855
she was teazed by Mr collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others. 3.6835178958676513
i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong. 1.9575799740674853
" "very true , indeed ; and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody. 1.9445139454540745
"lizzy , " said he , "what are you doing ? are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? have not you always hated him ? " how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to Mr darcy. 1.8950964586557173
i was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her. 1.9342872391756736
they have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better. 1.8205086823147854
her astonishment , however , was extreme ; and continually was she repeating , "why is he so altered ? from what can it proceed ? it cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened. 1.8856458715770839
their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection. 2.6764332769028463
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. 2.6707809831834934
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter. 1.9430011202279085
i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen. 2.229116022914919
"what can be the meaning of this ! " said charlotte , as soon as he was gone. 2.763944642716286
how shall we punish him for such a speech ? " "nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said elizabeth. 2.5923807373587286
" elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. 1.9254112789015319
Mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker. 2.211537128656105
" chapter vii. 3.152383408479923
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return. 2.459699260413833
" "obstinate , headstrong girl ! i am ashamed of you ! is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? is nothing due to me on that score ? "let us sit down. 1.6316362042851056
" "and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ? " "how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ! i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister 's happiness with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. 1.9368575012033027
"indeed , Mr bennet , " said she , "it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! " "my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. 2.3983232001698593
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. 2.1534396546469976
the second began. 3.054491691641986
attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham. 2.6034704107975792
what an agreeable man sir william is , Mr bingley is not he ? so much the man of fashion ! so genteel and so easy ! he has always something to say to every body. 1.8910095233033162
"i should like to know how he behaves among strangers. 3.253325347331436
she could not think of darcy 's leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him ; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him. 2.4200179049680104
with many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for Mrs bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , "good lord ! sir william , how can you tell such a story ? do not you know that Mr collins wants to marry lizzy ? " nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william 's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy. 1.9296867433317952
for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to every body. 2.4923589185679598
i am so grieved for him. 2.640514719532763
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world. 2.5150503960082515
they had several children. 2.723189186397838
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin. 2.5445008089721592
"i have found out , " said he , "by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. 2.1965161062351473
the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master 's steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence. 2.1592051117552993
"i began to be afraid you would never come back again. 2.233606219717061
steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her. 2.1423918665116837
"well , lizzy , " said Mrs bennet one day , "what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane 's ? for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. 2.633819239167758
when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him ; and she sat down directly to the instrument. 2.3245721582174306
"how despicably have i acted ! " she cried. 2.3262618573831557
" "pardon me for interrupting you , madam , " cried Mr collins ; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. 1.9663335540369349
" jane shook her head. 2.552981881247136
charlotte herself was tolerably composed. 2.481059454495962
" Mr collins , " said she , "speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman. 2.4402535239133387
her answer was warmly in his favour. 3.013163481334028
i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother. 2.407276769673354
she says lizzy had better have taken Mr collins ; but i do not think there would have been any fun in it. 2.4700070113362784
she certainly did not hate him. 2.3405918442943188
"not yet , " replied jane. 3.3241623877972604
the hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs bennet 's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. 2.10660307062697
" "yes , in conjunction with his friend. 3.449971864985447
" "money ! my uncle ! " cried jane , "what do you mean , sir ? " "i mean , that no man in his senses , would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after i am gone. 2.338274826758191
when is your turn to come ? you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane. 2.8380434342642897
in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house. 2.8735339500884276
thank heaven ! i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. 2.043358699529074
jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected. 2.5877909656479345
Mr collins then returned to elizabeth. 2.390018103354649
during dinner , Mr bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. 2.8475806549654883
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together. 2.3675158015250397
but it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly. 3.212843246059701
but do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr darcy ? " "they are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine. 2.198293825272588
she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself. 2.861344571765721
nobody wants him to come. 2.9064926691635424
and when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether ; Mr bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man. 1.9831306749511928
in the former were many good paintings ; but elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy 's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible. 2.215718974535455
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent. 1.8573029572460975
" "nothing is more deceitful , " said darcy , "than the appearance of humility. 3.2538093642988666
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again. 2.326113267799314
"if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , "i shall know how to understand it. 2.2174051106645467
his doing so drew her notice. 2.3008806008379765
Number. 2.2885629017403297
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one. 2.0948504647782955
having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity. 1.9337033954327678
how you must have hated me after that evening ? " "hate you ! i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction. 2.089431286953479
as she went up stairs to get ready , Mrs bennet followed her , saying , "i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. 2.6417119434777256
" Mrs hill began instantly to express her joy. 2.247670472569997
" "i had much rather go in the coach. 2.1810049083951215
" after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant , there chanced to be a little alteration. 2.3904436372395983
this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. 2.357103011009832
" "upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except netherfield. 1.881172930803734
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. 2.03382784104694
you know i always speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. 2.174503488003773
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. 1.9469262018570725
royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the address specified in section Number , "information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation. 1.958689782742714
his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. 1.9427581592460612
"what , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? poor little lizzy ! but do not be cast down. 2.0216926499588923
her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room. 2.260836103040365
when a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty. 1.9435443885847248
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. 3.559188181625281
" "beyond a doubt , they do wish him to chuse miss darcy , " replied jane ; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. 2.2349965245122743
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. 2.042258758422248
what a stroke was this for poor jane ! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual. 2.101331570762848
"what would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? " were questions with which she amused herself. 2.145077055630157
" "is that his design in settling here ? " "design ! nonsense , how can you talk so ! but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes. 2.469921987637241
if i can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too. 3.1634593095621106
" "i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. 3.496208403705063
" "to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either. 1.8859212657588824
" "we are speaking of music , madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply. 2.6471236319160028
it will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance. 1.8827146101544625
Mr bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters. 2.5885340384251263
i ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr collins 's character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state. 1.9533364216584652
she saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers. 2.702669127889264
on the following monday , Mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn. 2.3414420438591144
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard. 2.0435442976687255
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked. 2.7843531850703123
i am perfectly serious in my refusal. 2.330260369618206
she has known him only a fortnight. 2.3248805735471607
" "there is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , i shall not be the person to discourage him. 2.2635229089021345
Mr hurst looked at her with astonishment. 2.7678278362313167
after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses. 2.161225959385345
" the effect was immediate. 2.89752735312943
we were married , you know , at st. 2.8295473964342364
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth 's salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word. 1.9757171614277367
" "indeed you are mistaken. 2.774806113373059
but , really , i know not what to say. 2.7587530556793722
" "that would be a good scheme , " said elizabeth , "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home. 2.3772320785463603
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her. 2.2577335510041703
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy. 2.466519818256781
"what does Mr darcy mean , " said she to charlotte , "by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? " "that is a question which Mr darcy only can answer. 2.11977697685024
she enquired into charlotte 's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her 's , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. 2.7219051158571688
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. 3.181579338672878
his family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion. 2.792817429987494
" "all this she must possess , " added darcy , "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading. 2.1088132133632014
lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me jane 's beauty. 2.408452007181033
Mr darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them. 2.563541236988151
my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can 't write ; so i will dictate , and you write for me. 2.980062908842454
you have employed your time much better. 2.610765726962422
f. 2.7701078899210225
e. 2.5002575954001145
mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. 1.9832739944026458
" "perfectly so i thank you. 2.736154479641599
she now lost every expectation of pleasure. 2.4200713265845426
you cannot have been always at longbourn. 2.4865253777473164
" when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. 2.1309144628479997
s. 3.2308717412205743
i had not an idea of it. 2.5885532910318982
miss bennet 's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. 2.379852479900102
"how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , Mr darcy , " she cried ; "i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter. 2.148528544211405
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment. 2.363628104943557
i am very glad you liked her. 2.4221128116715245
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment. 1.9410781698291957
my father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. 2.178674855358452
her report was highly favourable. 2.4942814941771587
i speak feelingly. 3.2223414122975553
it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. 2.3995209499428944
she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done. 2.3913190324523663
will you hear it ? " "most willingly. 3.0868092016089035
i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit. 2.789118881728285
all were struck with the stranger 's air , all wondered who he could be , and kitty and lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot. 1.82209874978594
a flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. 2.1172924685301333
through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance. 2.2904231773450725
" Mr bingley followed his advice. 2.4623594367436388
this was agreed to , and Mrs philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. 3.8849951004343675
we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her. 2.015599888100181
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn out like his information. 2.072287342609409
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend 's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power. 2.1913614430881436
Mr darcy walked off ; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. 2.206618437868383
from what he said of miss darcy , i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl. 2.4910465968729993
"how could i ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face. 3.1813215619300945
no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. 1.9758824999134539
he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement. 2.0424012901685034
" this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham 's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. 1.9247765554698688
" "i have already told her so once , by your desire. 2.0750650711705556
he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room. 2.7241620397265094
" "you must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied elizabeth. 2.527299618689411
he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. 2.0952485579564724
it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them. 2.832865342350161
" "no more have i , " said Mr bennet ; "and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you. 2.4791925170960676
after a short silence , the lady first spoke. 2.3423901904410775
" consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband 's incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr bingley in consequence of it , before they did. 2.969525042302472
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. 2.0702345145366734
the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter. 2.0831128610493903
elizabeth could not help saying , "it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so. 2.7458139650899516
" "yes ; but he seemed to like his second better. 2.4805448871134734
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it. 2.856377167726217
he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her. 2.197677668816681
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. 2.041634646650939
darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence. 2.2341141943566036
" "i am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly. 2.862630652030376
" elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend. 2.70763895453123
" as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , "i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. 2.210016282609692
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman. 2.365727107113648
in three volumes. 2.5269154595070877
but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister 's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched. 2.312077509407205
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort. 2.299443576157677
" "well , " cried elizabeth , "have it as you choose. 2.871271224225781
at our time of life , it is not so pleasant i can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing. 3.275383766578661
all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum. 1.9261009609564648
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. 2.018854494423537
they now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought. 2.935697721670138
i hope she will turn out well. 2.2424339633455292
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther. 2.294974337794559
Mrs bennet could hardly contain herself. 2.343968535340148
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but Mrs bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , "you are very kind , sir , i am sure ; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough. 2.3549465001984413
could there be finer symptoms ? is not general incivility the very essence of love ? " "oh , yes ! of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt. 2.013315143868866
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ? he danced only four dances ! i am sorry to pain you but so it was. 2.0529782835873487
"did you speak from your own observation , " said she , "when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? " "from the former. 1.9643743028144236
i do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , jane one does not often see any body better looking. 2.8292837345336603
by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary. 2.4017332749305846
" "i say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other. 2.424852715569442
well , colonel fitzwilliam , what do i play next ? my fingers wait your orders. 2.1881314664147613
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him. 3.292360153894627
she will make him a very proper wife. 2.4296734824643864
it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture. 2.211360479760239
with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand. 2.0861428965664635
i am glad he dines here on tuesday. 2.6260309759994382
" the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while. 2.019388509064951
in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her ; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief. 2.5300656658483454
he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably. 2.8601122693017604
" "i have heard much of your master 's fine person , " said Mrs gardiner , looking at the picture ; "it is a handsome face. 2.8035892918614147
Mr denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , Mr wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps. 3.0809685034276084
it is such a spur to one 's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind. 2.640604821011371
in three volumes. 2.5269154595070877
not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the pemberley house , is a powerful motive. 3.1188575383743005
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia 's connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to every thing ? impossible. 1.8959268901853041
" "i did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly. 2.2943510938722973
" elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. 2.3401003918622023
the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground. 3.6450742273099404
" "i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at pemberley. 1.7923884397917262
Number. 2.2885629017403297
you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these. 2.215975843715914
jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs. 1.731112643279861
the children have been wanting me this half hour. 2.0533287496345225
as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. 2.705070801543454
" "upon my word , caroline , i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation. 1.9591038576767774
" Mr darcy smiled ; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh. 2.3395961360816586
on this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared. 2.180620764341037
"yours , &c. 2.8392038003601776
the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention. 2.387062025181244

rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother inlaw 's intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. 2.5721880380710522

instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected Mr bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine 's visit. 1.9884245787736283
" "she seems a very pleasant young woman , " said bingley. 2.5754867240554935
" but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte 's wishes , to be the case ; and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year. 2.6483602359495575

the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again. 2.1813597651716954

not that i mean to find fault with you , for such things i know are all chance in this world. 1.9173928041379475
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine 's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte 's observation , and hurried her away to her room. 1.9370335097898514
" "let her be called down. 2.3174985739909184
her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire. 2.0211789887981997
you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. 1.8215689136144122
" "whatever i do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; "and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes. 1.9936987412383975
i am afraid you will be angry. 3.0880027361878235
" "pride , " observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , "is a very common failing i believe. 2.345062963996692
what could your ladyship propose by it ? " "at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted. 2.2252421716703434
oh , brother , how kind you are ! i know you will contrive it all. 2.020675310945818
his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking. 2.5786117791945946
mamma would like to go too of all things ! only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! " "yes , " thought elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once. 2.0862346733510275
"and then , " said she , "if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. 2.0013612689147133
" at that moment they were met from another walk , by Mrs hurst and elizabeth herself. 2.153162602545176
" "has your governess left you ? " "we never had any governess. 2.1413153400653195
and then we were so merry all the way home ! we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! " to this , mary very gravely replied , "far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures. 2.0431795580624095
but we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride. 2.497740507041799
elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from pemberley. 2.1664088938781965
his apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else. 3.8034379503348976
" "this is the only point , i flatter myself , on which we do not agree. 2.9821155965085895
" "i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want. 1.9924514402096807
" her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation. 1.8020299929943984
the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him. 2.6212737151845507
his appearance was greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address. 2.6628144583025013
every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time. 2.4220385113017575
"yes , ma 'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor. 2.5736653960594005
the adieu is charity itself. 2.503828538689617
when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year ; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both. 2.0570342141574933
" "but consider your daughters. 2.442953397976021
Mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. 2.2154460597791665
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day. 2.2973443752406384
" "it is no such thing. 2.386575389794392
he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend. 2.9279909627649277

" elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. 2.2042964615765204
elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. 2.350283427389838
Mr bennet 's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother 's fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his. 2.391561869321066
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. 2.2575230231813914
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued the subject , by saying , "but tell me all and every thing about it , which i have not already heard. 2.0240467140678375

she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange. 2.1851102181292754

" "no " said darcy , "i have made no such pretension. 2.722384188468251
when alone with elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject. 2.5579637889848406
charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. 2.2923126195810415
the one missent must be first attended to ; it had been written five days ago. 2.1528453994106616
he was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , "just as you please. 3.4673878666947617
she could not determine how her mother would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. 1.7415177697930306
Mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane ; but as he took up his abode with the lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs bennet. 1.8030104469457948
i am very , very sorry. 2.6683582031210102
Mr wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry. 1.7832736832130611
" "he likes to have his own way very well , " replied colonel fitzwilliam. 3.1514529261746382
" "at four o 'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace making gentleman , " said Mr bennet , as he folded up the letter. 3.2634357637211684
he did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately. 1.784873959309027
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life. 2.1940092755031455
Mr collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr darcy 's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way. 2.3680484147626872

"or in other words , you are determined to have him. 2.5436030667785836
she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , "this must be false ! this cannot be ! this must be the grossest falsehood ! " and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again. 2.0349634924293305
much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday ; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married. 2.220348465976481
" elizabeth looked surprised. 2.9809045647631325
they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt. 1.971283019452368
" "is it possible ! " cried elizabeth , when she had finished. 2.9339450210228453
Mrs philips 's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley 's good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar. 2.3643827690310206
his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit. 2.117394964130172
wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her. 2.4157112060245085
"i am sorry to hear that ; but why did not you tell me so before ? if i had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on him. 2.180444033551966
" "i wish i might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful. 2.208825545741843
his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing. 2.219660699282643
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out. 1.990272418950922
"oh , lizzy ! it cannot be. 2.982829069938306
at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies. 2.996501261871467
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? oh ! no. 1.9482608773861423

he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names. 2.3118784580628344
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought , nor their offences against myself. 2.6494866910202246
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. 3.3874685891437624
"i hope , " added Mrs gardiner , "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. 2.750588462237416
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me. 2.759902857587976
Mr bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister 's , Mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man. 2.274977253948348
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth. 1.8195313597243643

let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers. 2.6435473363012436
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. 1.9601969812749136
"my dear , dear lydia ! " she cried : "this is delightful indeed ! she will be married ! i shall see her again ! she will be married at sixteen ! my good , kind brother ! i knew how it would be i knew he would manage every thing. 1.8295189246691066
" "then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said Mrs bennet ; "and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly. 2.7525442365150714
" "do let us have a little music , " cried miss bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share. 2.5662944768761364
"it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane , " said she. 3.362803768104136

"indeed i have , sir , " was her answer. 2.699191479136538
they attacked him in various ways ; with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas. 2.4786433753742747
there was no arguing upon such a project. 2.428114426008336
bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased. 2.407967024360369

"not at all. 3.2763943373406588
the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words. 2.179150884604271
"kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room. 2.0877307713206705
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more. 2.1182119593054027
jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from caroline. 2.875237569239801
"and that , " said Mrs reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , "is my master and very like him. 2.1326737933090123
" Mr darcy , who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. 2.694911125239752
his disposition must be dreadful. 2.579616686518523
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr bingley. 2.1681376783825748
" "that is right. 2.718676938752922
"nay , " said elizabeth , "this is not fair. 3.9227507303537092
she has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever. 2.1925280676765673
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself. 1.953515815453027

with the mention of derbyshire , there were many ideas connected. 2.5530251772645567
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end. 2.1743706997703995
" "and this is your real opinion ! this is your final resolve ! very well. 2.2300901542476987
at present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and meryton was the head quarters. 2.593470922247505

vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled ! oh ! my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? " Mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , "do not make yourself uneasy , my love. 2.1237905487812747
" "undoubtedly. 3.042504937715624
to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected. 3.9161779976121585
"dear sir , "i must trouble you once more for congratulations. 2.3087011717487194
) "well , so much the better. 2.3786979927383842
after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquire if Mr wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball. 2.0094615057793175
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. 2.0205920190792868
when breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane. 2.1673350532285025
he comes down on thursday at the latest , very likely on wednesday. 2.6722095281122202
he was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , "i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , ' she a beauty ! i should as soon call her mother a wit. 2.087376724120705
but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister 's indifference. 2.1536576848099216
Mr collins 's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. 1.8651722892001934
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. 1.8041531095914707
but tell me , what did you come down to netherfield for ? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequence ? " "my real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me. 1.7767851018816034

" elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together. 2.455439226366239
" this roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once. 2.4023792738306673
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way. 1.937949143125546
the business was therefore soon settled. 2.419855557612266
"well , lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , "and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ? well , well , i only hope it will last. 2.009381734315592
"i admire all my three sons inlaw highly , " said he. 2.3566283382082145
to the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr bingley 's , she could not make a very favourable answer. 2.511558233941982
it was really a very handsome thought. 2.7112618318008908
there is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. 2.2362081259659874
"i am astonished , " said miss bingley , "that my father should have left so small a collection of books. 2.6901326745132805
" "you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir. 2.1775318431757014
Mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. 2.2345381508030426
at present , however , i consider myself as quite fixed here. 2.7419926192452775
he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting. 2.7054117332237273
i have written to colonel forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr wickham in and near brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which i have pledged myself. 2.505592114327019
she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr darcy and herself. 1.8046628975418315
i must beg to return to the house. 2.4292158654645353
he was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire ; but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane 's letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no fresh pain. 2.1693144220413907
" she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. 2.5739562186540046
you know him too well to doubt the rest. 2.369396251314164
elizabeth was now to see Mr wickham for the last time. 2.478596241023146
fatigued as she had been by the morning 's walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance. 3.156596285651267

anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn. 2.641167492162462
she enquired after his sister , but could do no more. 2.398464258503157

" "with the officers ! " cried lydia. 2.5719413516058296
you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last. 2.0258498157999965
" "exceed their income ! my dear Mr bennet , " cried his wife , "what are you talking of ? why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more. 2.2612374665142596
" "was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , while she was ill at netherfield ? " "dearest jane ! who could have done less for her ? but make a virtue of it by all means. 1.8143797710252196
his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. 3.048407652010974
there can be no love in all this. 2.5113056089579064
that Mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as Mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings. 2.3114543717680984
as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , "this is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of. 1.891242398311703
it is because he will not give himself the trouble. 2.7112131974761016
they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose. 2.661314691238586
"i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? " "i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation. 2.7266628017112216
it was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing. 2.792733128590082
" elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin 's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation. 3.160212040538038
it is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife. 2.153554780570989
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment ; and i trust i am resigned. 2.3804522304284337
but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art. 3.425733769197314
ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it. 2.4879702180549437
it was a large , well proportioned room , handsomely fitted up. 2.253398163489436
be that as it may , she saw him go with regret ; and in this early example of what lydia 's infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. 2.4633239468587242
my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself. 2.4391803171295807
" "i must not decide on my own performance. 2.1184651504931713
all elizabeth 's anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again. 1.8773099090959962
her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. 1.8347361505860869
" "i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object. 2.321188788429617
by tea time however the dose had been enough , and Mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. 2.3189632037941137
the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherine 's behaviour was most friendly and obliging. 3.6118876093213546
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers. 2.675759019596066
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. 2.0740630863662353
after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read. 2.051983569163682
"no , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night. 2.4127287900084893
but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead. 2.075233792669671
" "the present always occupies you in such scenes does it ? " said he , with a look of doubt. 2.5878800755345654
i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr denny comes back from town. 2.3265697982455014
every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight. 2.5611076551987066
to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add. 2.4294246051078994
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her. 2.6292892192233186
she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung. 2.5532297903871473
Number. 2.2885629017403297
his father , miss bennet , the late Mr darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had ; and i can never be in company with this Mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. 2.6056821634756306
if , as i conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. 1.9210344681989258
- you provide , in accordance with paragraph Number. 2.663952018221212
the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of Mrs forster , the delight of Mrs bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described. 2.6559051482224953
" and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not Mr collins thus addressed her , "when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character. 1.88503915497828
easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important. 2.1854429414777203
when she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner 's in town , so much in love with her , that my sister inlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. 2.3223091181848052
"but the wife of Mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine. 2.59789994022481
and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , what could it mean ? that he should even speak to her was amazing ! but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. 1.7164827636549644
" "shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine , what is to befall her ? " "i am more likely to want time than courage , elizabeth. 2.4318349745176673
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham 's departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. 2.0136460044565943
this information , however , startled Mrs bennet ; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so. 2.5030272439524963
' but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time. 3.0201324416858855
i dare say i shall soon see them here. 2.4434896903887204
the officers will find women better worth their notice. 2.0520738292658125
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have been left as printed. 2.564303338582014
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled. 2.8033831575667394
but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. 2.045701193295484
but she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies. 1.8388990718446079
lord ! how i laughed ! and so did Mrs forster. 2.2562349064095915
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. 2.309186532980566
if the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem. 1.9155865544795556
" thursday was to be the wedding day , and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose to take leave , elizabeth , ashamed of her mother 's ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room. 2.6718797994134564
Mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off. 2.035964382423628
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good naturedly engaged Mr collins 's conversation to herself. 2.202692007811942
to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success ; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. 2.0347337255195512
"aye , there she comes , " continued Mrs bennet , "looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way. 2.2691868467055007
" "another time , lizzy , " said her mother , "i would not dance with him , if i were you. 3.066463662721491
"i have sent for you on an affair of importance. 2.394509241915391
Mr bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. 2.0551648139372474
her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines. 2.1240036764514283
to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed. 2.584212892179933
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do. 2.0737629154031083
their parties abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp. 2.2040222561114313
elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion. 38.76667236686282
perhaps there was some truth in this ; though i doubt whether his reserve , or anybody ' s reserve , can be answerable for the event. 2.4142570214156964
"i wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer. 2.721333732098681
" this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities. 2.170996279310045
Mr darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me. 2.5979603460399585
"the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , i hope , improved in civility. 2.2486666260566928
anxiety on jane 's behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Mr darcy 's explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost. 2.1386892718055868
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever. 2.773239422845078
"what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia ! " she cried. 2.3987041185136215
there is one point , on which i want your advice. 2.451498919314618
she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress. 2.5607201431881497
i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject. 3.1029069848963355
if you mention my name at the bell , you will be attended to. 2.38321813270384
" they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister 's sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good humoured smile , "come , Mr wickham , we are brother and sister , you know. 2.386311133340287
"but i can assure you , " she added , "that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing. 2.1894348967370263
i will take care of myself , and of Mr wickham too. 3.1764440271577503
"what is Mr darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ? i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear. 2.2980942482891025
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself. 2.09200680678454
" "his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said elizabeth angrily ; "for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr darcy 's steward , and of that , i can assure you , he informed me himself. 2.284679151822999
anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil. 1.9324244623535272
" miss bennet still looked all amazement. 2.2372478371851843
i had often seen him in love before. 2.5912184343128435
she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , "i am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! what do you think has happened this morning ? Mr collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him. 2.1578728927714326
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections. 2.080043170400644
but gracious me ! i quite forgot ! i ought not to have said a word about it. 1.9120231304752742
what could be the meaning of it ? it was impossible to imagine ; it was impossible not to long to know. 2.681911239660119
their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. 46.016054471307854
he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions. 2.33029632680393
but what is that to me ? if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh. 2.0872851188192265
wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison. 2.2026259730233173
chapter iii. 3.1520790291911487
every thing nourishes what is strong already. 2.5915870802113434
" then turning to Mr bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon. 2.2980808740832503
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. 1.928988642077841
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations. 2.9046808131738056
"it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say ; but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas 's. 2.35656187044248
Mr collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family. 2.599385775641165
maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire. 2.6067453198263086
it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy 's , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning. 2.269051539629833
but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money. 2.2445314662652116
your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land. 2.6284175828572307
" "is my father in town ? " "yes , he went on tuesday as i wrote you word. 2.0083250011561846
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs hurst and miss bingley ; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. 2.1289983282690788
"he is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , "that ever lived. 2.9379971257027866
"of music ! then pray speak aloud. 2.206213809503116
" "but i was embarrassed. 2.49370046958837
when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent. 2.2046561108193177
such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr bingley 's continued absence. 3.1502031324076927
" "i am far from attributing any part of Mr bingley 's conduct to design , " said elizabeth ; "but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery. 2.23315758244447
it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. 2.393854415660708
they are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain. 2.449521505931236
such was miss lucas 's scheme ; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon. 2.117021647348446
chapter vii. 3.3368282430866345
you blamed me for coming ? " "no indeed ; i felt nothing but surprise. 2.218247610224098
excuse me for i must speak plainly. 2.4576436832910553
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; hopeless of seeing him before. 2.03790402137425
she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and i understand highly accomplished. 2.2335397029531157
console lady catherine as well as you can. 3.166121012048888
in lydia 's imagination , a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. 2.127295510259062
it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before ; and she asked bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. 2.3157983750081987
" "i beg you would not put it into lizzy 's head to be vexed by his ill treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. 1.9118142942784722
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other. 2.04161823765304
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair. 2.3392709121645847
" "but , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , i am sure. 2.560009939581047
" elizabeth longed to observe that Mr bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself. 2.346469501846389
not that i am afraid of myself , but i dread other people 's remarks. 3.530352813455923
" "indeed ! " cried wickham with a look which did not escape her. 2.3442194633920117
" "it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends. 2.3490915590322206
"when i consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , "that i might have prevented it ! - i who knew what he was. 2.147538589678086
the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; they were dances of mortification. 2.478474221352522
in talking over their route the evening before , Mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again. 2.599414233252645
"my dear friend , "if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day 's tête àtête between two women can never end without a quarrel. 1.9521341352743626
my father , however , is partial to Mr wickham. 3.276860218236243
she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne 's. 2.6810855040032067
he was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey. 1.8241842335337952
let us hope for better things. 2.283631495413205
there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth 's mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance. 1.9572318910161677
upon the whole , i am much pleased with him. 3.6362033511307055
good heaven ! brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton. 2.5590512722252625
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from Mr wickham. 1.9517138360860293
as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth. 2.1955167403923985
" scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to rosings. 3.0660435090899814
can you , yourself , lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? " "not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. 2.5141789872012588
but you are always giving her the preference. 2.37581728399631
his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , jane 's happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured. 3.0391069091072045
" elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more. 2.179402423633512
she could think of nothing but of Mr wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home ; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor Mr collins were once silent. 2.0288520969404646
Mrs bennet 's schemes for this day were ineffectual. 2.3079117721846734
we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him. 2.740013858175454
pray go to see them , with sir william and maria. 2.49476878948161
on finding Mrs bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , "may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? " before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Mrs bennet instantly answered , "oh dear ! yescertainly. 2.140534643216688
put them next to your great uncle the judge. 2.0476830227233886
" "yes , " replied wickham ; - "his estate there is a noble one. 2.2605471571277262
she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked. 2.5597149769480243
it must be an amusing study. 3.065600973980976
"oh ! yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! she plays and sings all day long. 2.2162212367480656
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill. 2.7181827652631885
i will speak to her about it myself directly. 2.2738558835933347
Mr bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house. 2.2124826687808397
with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning. 1.927278028745472
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , Mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all. 2.950720507292958
"what could become of Mr bingley and jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs. 2.11998713507693
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate. 1.9264328194050868
" jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail. 2.2546699629521
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. 2.7238363073942087
" and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house. 1.9865402695943457
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her. 1.9361089060199075
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. 3.0852467100246455
Mr bennet 's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. 1.980726887319458
perhaps he thought her too young. 2.4694823153223826
he now wished it more than ever. 2.8756312657420136
charlotte 's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be ; though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. 1.9238299875166387
i want to talk very seriously. 3.0422731383429933
chapter vi. 3.3368282430866345
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret. 2.3677980878644336
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. 2.0231097242030285
but enough of this. 3.2823795025216027
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr darcy that Mr darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week. 3.1410693644211567
good bye. 3.076104346356208
to pemberley , therefore , they were to go. 4.000014645090461
i enquired after their brother , of course. 2.609532873947058
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. 2.0525946666356814
" "did not you ? i did for you. 2.2084539087079578
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks. 1.8676759669620753
their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush. 2.8371126612891
"it was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , "as soon as his marriage was fixed on. 2.869821242280293
" "i deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried elizabeth ; "i am not a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things. 2.3194783414434803
every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable. 3.1680657601638744
" words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences. 3.22847523773751
she saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown. 2.940293413079451
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish. 2.456681564565907
i wish you had been there. 2.6450235033127694
the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her. 1.9446359604885992
jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way. 2.7051733805914777
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance. 1.8385406206617663
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door. 2.162397495309397
elizabeth immediately began playing again. 2.4546852114808133
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last. 3.8080331531020684
such a charming man ! so handsome ! so tall ! oh , my dear lizzy ! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. 1.9656844565476295
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one. 2.3916408062818357
" "would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " "he made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty. 2.2185556930023456
imprudent as a marriage between Mr wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland. 1.7988845726914875
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. 2.426591535103868
" "in what an amiable light does this place him ! " thought elizabeth. 2.0517943677860586
but your family owe me nothing. 2.717216685852386
i would go and see her , if i could have the carriage. 2.9596486391542434
" after many pauses and many trials of other subjects , elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying , "i am astonished at his intimacy with Mr bingley ! how can Mr bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? how can they suit each other ? do you know Mr bingley ? " "not at all. 2.6257959392515913
she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself. 2.578287837150078
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your 's. 2.2899987278202043
chapter x. 3.1520790291911487
if he had another motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him. 2.6040089749944606
" "oh ! but the gentlemen will have Mr bingley 's chaise to go to meryton ; and the hursts have no horses to theirs. 2.366092679009797
lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good humoured as lydia. 2.6697844988268358
her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms. 2.1738867168516314
their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves. 2.8191627352645163
" "and my mother how is she ? how are you all ? " "my mother is tolerably well , i trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken. 1.9247967108782467
you must and shall be married by a special licence. 2.044036593260452
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs bennet 's sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away. 4.628855131995126
but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it. 2.3049942377283177
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. 2.705309501714738
" "i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more. 2.1034878485658965
they will have nothing else to do. 2.558614337659985
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. 1.950172147127822
as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. 1.9237316718464348
but that is one great difference between us. 2.7158359354419024
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. 1.748581228974099
" "did you go by the village of kympton ? " "i do not recollect that we did. 2.2864923691584713
at length the parsonage was discernible. 2.71364055263332
chapter xii. 3.1520790291911487
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class. 1.9260988225130942
i do not trust my own partiality. 2.4740836107014204
what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received ! he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex. 2.0868150665453626
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself. 1.791468324937613
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her. 2.292176145914489
i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection. 1.7695261631572996
" "our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money. 2.458442537741776
do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified. 3.5297258480461045
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks. 2.096382295467926
i hope they will not meet at all. 2.5206959067917722
" darcy was fixed in astonishment. 2.4002662114813775
his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days time. 2.081600131229225
the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr bingley ? " "when i am in the country , " he replied , "i never wish to leave it ; and when i am in town it is pretty much the same. 2.4895969528679944
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. 2.850429602890199
" elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying. 2.5604349652938767
" elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit. 2.2891099162686914
" "well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. 3.089330652987701
Mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it. 2.3210968694051677
"you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , i am sure , to oblige us for one half hour. 2.3482704002431305
we now come to the point. 2.871923027723532
"i am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said lady catherine ; "and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal. 2.878172094067044
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede. 1.9423713919584105
he then handed her in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings. 3.25823896631726
did you see him while you were at lambton ? i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had. 1.910483459161256
" "my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents. 1.9156155534945716
Number. 2.2885629017403297
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer. 2.4561508960918035
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations. 2.5286002995930765
" "oh ! if that is all , i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better. 2.0148413516145744
" the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir william 's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together. 2.4304202527900642
" it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. 2.036176672655424
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. 2.344680559187757
" "insolent girl ! " said elizabeth to herself. 2.9459780647505247
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention. 3.4539044870950697
" but Mr gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters. 2.2192990278218243
"i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society ; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas. 1.9938192392965992
"if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside , " cried bingley , "it would not make them one jot less agreeable. 3.2004131719046183
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again. 2.0311588831931084
i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. 2.1362519092837955
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. 1.8788044246751716
" "and they must marry ! yet he is such a man ! " "yes , yes , they must marry. 2.9075298526042497
"can it be possible that he will marry her ? " "wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her sister. 2.36713694627873
" Mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then added , "may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr and Mrs collins well. 1.9338022812497861
when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on Mr bennet to return to longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband 's not being killed in a duel. 2.318060290316528
tell him what a dreadful state i am in , that i am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day. 2.371479493310814
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park. 2.2940772527696556
if you have not been mistaken here , i must have been in an error. 2.7720224975757177
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment ; and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged. 2.3205929903193745
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss ! i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted. 2.754168978344659
" "i do not cough for my own amusement , " replied kitty fretfully. 2.8368024325543777
they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either. 2.3884937704557743
" "you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. 1.8074072855838497
Mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. 2.827228261672983
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg tm 's goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. 2.5612976077935388
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister 's room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. 2.2441097984057548
Mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth. 2.271333004224024
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure. 2.185710697121317
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in no cheerful humour. 2.3524046500294404
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect. 2.747165281801515
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. 2.258506865153873
but we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation. 3.884550863589681
not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , "jane , i congratulate you. 2.50721521341643
i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me. 2.2841463091428893
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her. 2.828688964959661
you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much. 2.307139733735377
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this. 2.3893729962033974
"you are joking , lizzy. 3.0299590754387364
but , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if i still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. 1.9193122534427338
he promises fairly , and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent. 2.210520412596439
if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight. 3.2230210697553456
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. 3.230511771153802
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in kent ? " "i have heard from authority , which i thought as good , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron. 2.1837331452515496
on their being joined by Mr bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery. 2.0570047918820125
in as short a time as Mr collins 's long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. 2.3877777571927683
" "i thank you for my share of the favour , " said elizabeth ; "but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands. 13.12206672074919
all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road. 2.3792961363764027
" "this is a wretched beginning indeed ! my sole dependence was on you ; and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not. 2.2763969992911277
their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the collinses ' reach. 2.301791381872139
in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin. 2.0839797736635366
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. 2.1498021988031732
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. 2.062953811179982
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl. 2.0266808816520028
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. 2.3098159498405137
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way. 1.8551624006519116
one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it. 2.5366451710131632
"what do you think ? it is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like. 2.0429525179458774
in a few minutes , Mrs bennet half opened the door and called out , "lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you. 2.5607179959497186
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body. 1.8384481557698542
lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation. 2.3639175573050295
" she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter. 2.3631150522676077
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , i am sure. 2.2426628830293667
Mr bingley 's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before. 2.079071953544093
their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy 's. 2.443805141434691
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin 's corroboration. 2.3864207070379315
don 't think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side. 2.331369522908028
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met. 2.1183072839410886
i am sorry to say it of them , but so it is. 3.2919418216867067
" from herself to jane from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr darcy 's explanation there , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again. 2.095782023590944
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs bennet 's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband. 2.752644958835534
she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. 2.145414229933966
at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas 's accidental information , that bingley 's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. 2.028079357864335
and in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away. 2.228175098552946
much as i respect them , i believe , i thought only of you. 2.6056958463742204
she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion of her. 2.7245648067285035
they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent. 2.368368037412405
but he is an ugly fellow ! i am glad he is gone. 3.2192182823911675
but their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle. 2.336268288200675
such a disappointment ! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! it is really too distressing. 2.4905330487592456
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter ; and in farther justification of Mr darcy , she could not but allow that Mr bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits. 2.513108282358493
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy. 2.886579488495628
certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as i was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it. 2.853849707823235

darcy said nothing at all. 2.981030250684095
"i hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , "you will give your mother inlaw a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers. 2.2710978930050936
the gentlemen arrived early ; and , before Mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out. 5.147089573450375
he was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company. 2.049561016115365
" the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. 1.9388434819323361
he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry. 1.9633212463659
my temper would perhaps be called resentful. 2.227342301571663
but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour ; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits ; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice. 3.4308156920757518
it was kindly meant. 2.6706778003899143
she was ashamed to think how much. 2.900666785078688
his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go. 2.1992448321272753
"well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , "and what do you think of my husband ? is not he a charming man ? i am sure my sisters must all envy me. 2.2638078980408367
they are my old friends. 2.7879478384102483
miss bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room. 2.3965722564089176
they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other. 2.306561775760796
she looked at jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns. 2.3610156770884894
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers. 2.4032977077232935
Mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley 's visit in gracechurch street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance. 1.8759304604014277
but , alas ! the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin 's affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question. 1.9586298178107258
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected. 2.350151606401408
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post. 2.0848588602294935
" this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret. 2.1630064683655537

" "and mary king is safe ! " added elizabeth ; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune. 2.239945318759409
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? " elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , "you are mistaken , Mr darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner. 1.804977031323445

you dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind. 2.4778332856388787
Mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else. 2.2801855781846885
she coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth. 2.6058470567600303
" "he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied elizabeth with emphasis , "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life. 2.039696814011773
his brother inlaw , Mr hurst , merely looked the gentleman ; but his friend Mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year. 1.9856372581888435
" charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. 2.8553729526578318

" elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. 2.0524389750113246

conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none. 2.7705384607809598
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each. 2.605892017967119
elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane 's being in the fairest way for happiness. 2.6885904118303237
he was received by Mrs bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend. 2.156156521317314
Mr hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep. 2.968887434781637

a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self importance and humility. 2.243626864509966
Mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless. 2.6958892525163063

- "i , who have prided myself on my discernment ! i , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust. 2.01533677475999
every body is disgusted with his pride. 2.67159351936075
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley 's voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family. 2.4169385528498877
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield. 2.003645784724798
he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , "i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. 2.1502792433612807
she was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition. 2.133056641319479
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud. 2.0424652509635326
her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself. 2.2322946619422503
she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success. 3.255038721327881
" "indeed , Mr collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary. 3.220538422448954

one morning , about a week after bingley 's engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. 2.2094712227031423
" "it did. 3.2619064905337685
" jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness. 2.306239724344717
it seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. 2.370517055431655
their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham 's extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them. 2.2374332883098162
" the whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and Mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and Mrs philips. 2.380328570714472

at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her. 2.446694049334612
" "oh ! certainly , " said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity ; "we will ask you no questions. 2.2435707923870147
" "and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ? did he know of their intending to go off ? had colonel forster seen denny himself ? " "yes ; but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it. 1.8178803030991746
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character. 2.539395292590339

" the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret. 2.4502711370779813
but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done. 2.85473561290581
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. 2.9861094049742993
" and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case. 3.0502793779751443

elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother 's schemes. 2.2779548681678
" their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford , they reached Mr gardiner 's house , where they were to remain a few days. 2.060977076168039
but these things happen so often ! a young man , such as you describe Mr bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent. 2.3314943067352885
bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable. 2.205986423786231
their table was superlatively stupid. 2.807062759593262

a lady 's imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment. 1.798007703222059
Mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets. 2.7471118084612023
" "but if you have got them to day , " said elizabeth , "my mother 's purpose will be answered. 2.1543855282314053
his plan did not vary on seeing them. 2.80345074792768
they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight. 2.4841538391435156
and do you really love him quite well enough ? oh , lizzy ! do any thing rather than marry without affection. 1.8795867659532197
on sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place. 1.8010522133405034
he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of Mr darcy. 2.1045674772836334
he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things. 2.505450834554667

not a syllable was uttered by either ; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room. 2.0715442587396953

she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial. 2.3973756294850492
he cannot know what Mr darcy is. 3.4326264525415446
it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel 's family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best. 2.145163810095302
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life. 1.9671406403857858
the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation. 1.9246019136219794
" in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , "i take no leave of you , miss bennet. 2.2379350776608797
" miss bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room. 2.1236027604757495
she was going to the butcher 's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed. 2.522302449905262

she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her 's , he might become a very agreeable companion. 2.208760149841353
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs bennet. 2.7208924706106665

" "miss elizabeth bennet ! " repeated miss bingley. 2.3518200078134517
but on returning to the drawing room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. 2.357052575983535
" elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , "yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that. 1.9689156792958402
here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. 2.0601113247402543
i shall certainly try to get the better. 2.504796077631084
miss bingley i am sure cannot. 3.2534772542862087
we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all. 2.4581369257149537
her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business. 1.9348324200383566

observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , "i hope Mr bingley will like it lizzy. 3.3208763497599887

the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable. 2.79030239203185
she then took a large house in edward street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. 2.1101572555705403
in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london. 2.4936048029797266
miss bingley 's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. 3.056070982053495
her hopes were answered ; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. 2.181781178334187
Mr bennet could not have chosen better. 3.9559829757412146
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. 2.3304135462716795
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command. 1.9652122583667135
these parties were acceptable to all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not. 1.7448999994730603
she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one 's approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by wickham. 2.266122685628822
some people call him proud ; but i am sure i never saw any thing of it. 2.999361483142122
they were not the only objects of Mr collins 's admiration. 2.6642555594481587
if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your 's , i can only say that i am sorry. 3.5528535058393462
"there is something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , "but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming. 3.40620327668007

on Mr and Mrs gardiner 's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness. 2.270713664230552
had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? " as she pronounced these words , Mr darcy changed colour ; but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued. 2.0755095403854797
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. 2.0488986877448654

"oh ! dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain. 2.1119575820089107
but really , ma 'am , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. 2.078507902920566
you may depend upon my seeking no further. 2.267900597756283
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. 3.5533408874317978
she was very equal therefore to address Mr bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. 2.5396204199978527
f. 2.7701078899210225
elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of Mr collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london. 2.0857483096929115
as they drove to Mr gardiner 's door , jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival ; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. 2.044734828620102
while sir william was with them , Mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road. 2.1139897796647813
if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen. 2.9801788552993944
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it. 1.7684904386177038
but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most. 2.031849662883517
such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them. 2.284998157511519
colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express. 2.4218188225500277

colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton. 1.8361595265165909
but her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton , these visitors came. 1.929411519457053

my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying Mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did. 1.9285461967125106
the party did not supply much conversation. 2.2777995461587945
" "i will not be interrupted. 3.6415661492248446
while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her. 2.2721301584306164
" she followed him thither ; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held. 2.1241511489543923
bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept. 2.0955543343671046
she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr darcy , she was directly retreating. 2.5890742906066904

the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. 1.9238837429202662
" "my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. 2.155844879031398
the possibility of meeting Mr darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred. 3.160857855246359
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be. 2.0636074170172347
"lizzy , you must not do so. 3.234063484686471
" "my dear , you flatter me. 2.6030362713660042
he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr and Mrs collins 's happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too. 1.9591539081713871
Mrs bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was. 1.8499013538599172
" "no , indeed , i did not. 3.282777825693254
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. 2.5317367676115308
and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , (for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time. 1.7284612753787656
mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters ' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance. 2.362515811062327
if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. 2.389738292729522
but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves. 2.0803893446977026
" "remember , eliza , that he does not know jane 's disposition as you do. 2.8132360019691625
Mrs hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr darcy 's eyes were fixed on her. 2.0434154171845083
"that is all very proper and civil , i am sure , " said Mrs bennet , "and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman. 2.907684264171985
her mother 's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much. 2.105138458049606
"oh ! " said she , "i heard you before ; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply. 2.622105190037237
as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner : - "you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither. 1.9874214220725557
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much. 2.7840226445259213
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of Mr darcy and his relation , colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself. 2.511954231023751
as all conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the room. 2.515573255441063
" "we will be down as soon as we can , " said jane ; "but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago. 2.5723908416654213
for my part , Mr bingley , i always keep servants that can do their own work ; my daughters are brought up differently. 1.9093729950401281
" "but that expression of 'violently in love ' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea. 3.6474271715405275
pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary ; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance. 1.8975620656058136
"i must ask whether you were surprised ? " said elizabeth. 2.348145790790526
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister. 1.941138464816264
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. 2.301328554100647
" "not the slightest. 2.7149308037380284
she approached , and saw the likeness of Mr wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle piece. 2.5726467833312854
"i am sure , " said she , "i cried for two days together when colonel millar 's regiment went away. 2.0036488379820097
" it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first. 2.8572459934848506
they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others. 2.582644202311725
Mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise. 2.3067712334569257
by supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy. 1.9403511898902168
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy 's marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth. 1.96030346857208
he carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear. 2.3775477177657995
i cannot understand it. 3.285152870556151
bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object. 4.178823793814935

when the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to elizabeth , "do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel. 3.3719510295080495
"if it were merely a fine house richly furnished , " said she , "i should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful. 3.0543700388502883

his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure. 2.1002235100765456

she was engaged one day as she walked , in re perusing jane 's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her. 1.94495769511147
" on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away. 2.131093437612504

it is done , however , and it was done for the best. 2.969851273390979
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did. 2.4108754628638787
it was first broken by Mrs annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on. 1.6975878851318824
"of a fine , stout , healthy love it may. 3.698531346222989

he wrote me a few lines on wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i particularly begged him to do. 2.687956066943251
far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , "to resent the behaviour of your daughter. 1.9717845660505318
"i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir. 2.7349654009993176

she could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended. 1.9869094497273496
it is too long ago. 2.5884053801928166
" elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing. 2.3487173280096387
from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him. 2.018280693871984
all was joy and kindness. 2.5664576049307697
we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye. 2.1547729943816902
let me do it without farther loss of time. 2.2280624489557965
the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which Mr collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship 's desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. 2.5946719246346763
as they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen. 1.8523392825388438
it was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit. 2.2927586910997504
" "i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. 3.1017117517297397
to the little town of lambton , the scene of Mrs gardiner 's former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of lambton , elizabeth found from her aunt , that pemberley was situated. 2.1824212334725765
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard , his claims on Mr darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter. 2.4007251602423194
" but of this answer lydia heard not a word. 2.270751745448961

kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia 's last letter , she had prepared her for such a step. 2.616067004035647
at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance. 2.8253114922176765
" her aunt assured her that she was ; and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented. 2.7234575628969395
she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become "stupid , disagreeable fellows. 2.168671151345533

it was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it. 1.95925157902113
is it true ? " elizabeth replied that it was. 2.857181789321688
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr darcy had been staying there. 2.0772252542241767
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone. 2.3105275918214616
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the Number per cents. 2.075384211585883
without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want. 1.9018697308882113
nay , were your friend lady catherine to know me , i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation. 2.0589789703796746
Mr collins made his declaration in form. 2.181303245368444
they are all for what they can get. 2.388010077107985
" the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte 's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. 2.0937513460827426
" "no governess ! how was that possible ? five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! i never heard of such a thing. 2.3438150960826523

" she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham. 2.438372683017288
" "is this , " thought elizabeth , "meant for me ? " and she coloured at the idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , "and pray , what is the usual price of an earl 's younger son ? unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds. 2.0193103810606257

" Mr darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter. 1.9688348628914243
" "i might as well enquire , " replied she , "why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? was not this some excuse for incivility , if i was uncivil ? but i have other provocations. 2.4002311334492137
" "for heaven 's sake , madam , speak lower. 2.523057688029369
" you were Mr bingley 's first choice. 2.7033719956709317
"you are too hasty , sir , " she cried. 2.8531402323325366
even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. 2.4159782879581098
their reception at home was most kind. 2.3199142555013386
Mr darcy replied with great intrepidity , "miss elizabeth bennet. 2.4022800891331206
when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in maria 's astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small. 2.0713992698762382
"i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows. 2.419463817884542
vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously. 1.9962763951971394
having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. 2.0981433830258487
" "yes ; he introduced us to his sister. 2.1867083070765165
i only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it. 2.052368658221996
what advantage can it be to you to offend Mr darcy ? you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing. 2.633091491631941
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects. 2.026620920709499
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before. 2.7510106047203617
and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia 's relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount. 2.212131375392974

she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion. 2.2034063385198577
she longed to see Mrs philips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " Mrs wickham , " by each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to Mrs hill and the two housemaids. 2.067021063852004
"but it is fortunate , " thought she , "that i have something to wish for. 2.3964703172848014
Mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride. 2.2758849618346266
his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , "what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ? what is it you are talking of ? what are you telling miss bennet ? let me hear what it is. 1.8457667274807548
this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving. 2.1142464883016365
if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. 1.9694652194566258

his character sunk on every review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr darcy 's sister , as , by wickham 's account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away. 2.2214274515049985
happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over ! " "i wish i could say any thing to comfort you , " replied elizabeth ; "but it is wholly out of my power. 2.227022898797931
its effect was most extraordinary ; for on first hearing it , Mrs bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable. 2.2802654134310134
as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out. 2.1767537393699175
" Mr darcy 's letter to lady catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what Mr bennet sent to Mr collins , in reply to his last. 2.2626830606399135
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer. 2.053130255082196

"his being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she ; "and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment. 2.259807738876792

elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room. 2.1107700918722707

Mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure. 2.0195041087888614

his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing. 2.0948662532447333
remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body 's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin. 2.110149614070206

here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery. 2.754185759538584
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? the general prejudice against Mr darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light. 2.181314204571147
Mr darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. 2.263500260986633
Mr darcy , you cannot deny the fact. 3.0349585319246795
the others have been gone on to scarborough , these three weeks. 3.0308257971469494
what a contrast between him and his friend ! Mr darcy danced only once with Mrs hurst and once with miss bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party. 2.693493723204187
" "that is not an unnatural surmise , " said fitzwilliam , "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin 's triumph very sadly. 2.8129224446763366
about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement. 2.0079366255513804
he begged pardon for having displeased her. 2.7574430442994085

the apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts. 2.4652479574809036
"you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other 's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , i should be completely in your way ; and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire. 1.8404927345388402
she had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years. 2.4639173694468015
the farewell between herself and Mr wickham was perfectly friendly ; on his side even more. 2.833911949268948
an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with wickham ! imagine our surprise. 1.8297355208517103

presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on. 2.0463929485696095
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished. 2.03090042866701
adieu to disappointment and spleen. 2.9544549889708054
as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte 's sake , she made more favourable than it really was. 2.5197384847710307
my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. 2.0009482101204417

she had very little notice from any but him. 2.1411245500422704
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude. 2.215403164840067
when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. 2.077496567443301
at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction. 2.1674972361511142
but Mr gardiner could not be seen , and Mr darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning. 2.44782000312449
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. 2.8855731897302572
" Mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? poor eliza ! to be only just tolerable. 1.9929924077215864
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy. 3.5747958020498714
but whatever may be the sentiments which Mr wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character. 1.7630308157900645
" as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind. 2.213645793168628
" "when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other. 2.2720256895621724
my father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property. 1.8427371823598087
" "very true ; and if i had my will , we should. 2.9197824006629305
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme. 1.9816035032131676
they followed her into the dining parlour. 2.763680803613412
her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome. 2.3911291436822952
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings ; and Mrs collins 's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. 2.2037626553154444
elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation. 1.8789086787292621
"next time you call , " said she , "i hope we shall be more lucky. 2.5565889509927855
miss bingley 's civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane ; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former. 2.3538368444290723
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility. 1.91384811240456
you are a gentleman 's daughter. 3.47848526131217
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood. 1.8583865969485573
" "i cannot believe it. 2.555783146930986
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. 2.11424364157167
" "true ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room. 1.8827306567639095
on opening the door , she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all. 2.81046631797485
what a good joke it will be ! i can hardly write for laughing. 2.381081806876445
it was gratitude. 2.9795554113757605
my dear hill , have you heard the good news ? miss lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding. 2.4033621831430687
the wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke. 1.8388642247408045
consider Mr collins 's respectability , and charlotte 's prudent , steady character. 2.6203438932680343
the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty seven , was elizabeth 's intimate friend. 1.9941316882801172
they agreed that Mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman 's conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together. 2.0124232948331433
" "that is not very likely ; our authority was too good. 1.902802967532217
" "my dear , " replied her husband , "i have two small favours to request. 2.890809700702986
and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ? we cannot suppose he would help it , if he could. 2.0084043860038094
let me mend it for you. 2.390459523805995
does she live near you , sir ? " "the garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from rosings park , her ladyship 's residence. 1.9959122240863494
lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , "do you know , mama , that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard , and if he does , colonel forster will hire him. 2.042052164677308
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley ; but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr darcy returned within the stated time. 1.7663019182277062
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother. 1.9708275883601356
" elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. 2.4745631302873203
her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening 's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. 2.6481145535232558
"i am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she. 3.525156178358338
" "i dislike it very much , " he replied ; "but it must be done. 2.5336311021646662
" "and men take care that they should. 2.376422921085275
it is enough to know they are discovered , i have seen them both " "then it is , as i always hoped , " cried jane ; "they are married ! " elizabeth read on ; "i have seen them both. 2.2080383359482827
he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it. 2.5028632484599997
i am perfectly satisfied. 2.8411870264532144
" elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr bingley 's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them. 2.212112825075882
" "what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ? for , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof. 2.4125310259999218
she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge. 2.4854417780611224
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother 's words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr darcy , who sat opposite to them. 2.1351798969879257
" "do you suppose them to be in london ? " "yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? " "and lydia used to want to go to london , " added kitty. 2.019482176732546
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but Mrs bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. 2.307496468922272
but with me , it is not so. 5.289833996124279
elizabeth 's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another. 1.77339701422319
"oh ! my dear Mr bennet , " as she entered the room , "we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball. 2.403688868656016
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare. 2.2636305479851835
society , i own , is necessary to me. 2.7434673771195732
wickham will never marry a woman without some money. 2.119995999823899
" "i can readily believe , " answered he gravely , "that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either. 2.444244603078073
he could even listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st. 2.251134109782011
" my mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at easter , i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh , widow of sir lewis de bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england. 2.132291360612114
he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. 2.2838943128070297
egerton , military library , whitehall. 2.2503288004435746
" "yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever. 2.3423208853867368
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon. 2.737455398041869
this letter is from Mr collins. 2.8042783366076236
Mrs bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of. 2.206648058733715
" "impossible , Mr bennet , impossible , when i am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? " "i honour your circumspection. 2.4580549927061677
it was my brother gardiner 's drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. 2.0753126168642044
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. 2.0893611167443504
we have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve. 2.1501192241619047
colonel fitzwilliam 's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out. 2.088926554691969
" elizabeth made no answer. 2.338400920815999
"oh ! yes i understand you perfectly. 2.341370137972279
" his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield. 2.6543527473884945
" "not at all , " he replied ; "they were brightened by the exercise. 2.8013816087778056
so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great. 2.4293023418019275
she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means. 2.5554782148194093
kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; (by the bye , Mrs forster and me are such friends ! ) and so she asked the two harringtons to come , but harriet was ill , and so pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? we dressed up chamberlayne in woman 's clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun ! not a soul knew of it , but col. 1.9361948019311677
she was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle 's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe. 1.9874862819831
"i did not think caroline in spirits , " were her words , "but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london. 2.3707662656091317
once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general charlotte wisely did not hear. 2.2230252622749758
it convinced her , that accident only could discover to Mr bingley her sister 's being in town. 2.32196139700166
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. 2.1069432495324323
she really looked almost wild. 2.480905822435491
" "no why should he ? if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections , because i had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? " "but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event. 2.0660149673425803
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner 's shop just over the way. 1.772360505711965
the horses were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them. 2.402721330383786
my dear jane , Mr collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as i do ; and you must feel , as well as i do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking. 2.346661341443775
" "but not before they went to brighton ? " "no , i believe not. 2.369701211148679
with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round. 3.0532964464184804
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. 2.435349358694091
" as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. 2.1666669072191858
you may have drawn him in. 3.0267943696869453
" "i suspected as much , " replied elizabeth. 2.5970908865082327
there is nothing else to be done. 2.952683656911301
Mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many. 1.7693629537982443
i must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music. 2.3808071540794433
"about a month , " said elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , "he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i understand. 2.4010138568743034
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant ; but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity. 2.303964446330174
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself. 2.353011927874911
" another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect ; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment. 2.222637987108365
but i confess they would have no charms for me. 2.2189194150186644
her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it. 2.2722572550160636
chapter xvi. 2.8498535182967997
" "it is difficult indeed it is distressing. 2.133536223044918
he was most highly esteemed by Mr darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend. 2.375839656430886
i should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire. 3.3502045090593273
the younger ones out before the elder are married ! your younger sisters must be very young ? " "yes , my youngest is not sixteen. 2.011497778548613
it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind. 2.4198211922903994
their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. 2.2305334937897103
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs bennet and the children. 2.350674031743264
" he paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to make any ; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , "my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing ? Mr darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. 2.88454417359109
do not distress me by the idea. 2.4741518890822216
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one. 2.125251745028152
" "have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ? but now it comes out. 1.9810290405424915
four weeks passed away , and jane saw nothing of him. 2.445885179859181
that is all to be forgot. 2.6237153498990695
* * * * * in the evening , soon after Mr bennet withdrew to the library , she saw Mr darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. 2.377976796017388
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense. 3.128455124307347
"she is my youngest girl but one. 2.6839386999449784
you shall not defend her , though it is charlotte lucas. 2.61006287925586
there are few people whom i really love , and still fewer of whom i think well. 2.182055988228076
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. 3.2818465592382577
are the others coming out ? " "i do not know. 2.6235430964067805
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal. 2.396641021836831
when Mr collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by charlotte 's evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten. 2.0321541389038833
" "i should be sorry indeed , if it were. 2.52061403070565
"i cannot make him out. 3.0661917557060767
he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else. 2.73451664507839
" "you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner. 1.9543050558195687
she had gained her point , and had time to consider of it. 2.4113611165003435
nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. 3.075001683702761
he is his own master. 2.6012025401646284
she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave. 2.594981715843547
"this will not do , " said elizabeth. 3.6294764490306752
" "and do you impute it to either of those ? " "yes ; to the last. 3.1255407550686582
about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire , to which he belonged. 2.1888963808114874
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. 2.114877161605579
contributions to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by u. 6.31285661700396
she would not listen therefore to her daughter 's proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable. 2.000841513223698
"if i , " said Mr collins , "were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. 2.660069711907335
" "to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! what could she mean by it ? it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum. 1.9704666288183816
when at length they arose to take leave , Mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation. 2.0631377891090072
that reply will do for the present. 2.415411711814588
it needed all jane 's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity. 1.869831411355967
it cannot last long. 2.66641806706742
when this was done , she had a less active part to play. 2.49353519559622
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. 2.191189939735004
his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it. 2.795622886556555
" "write to me very often , my dear. 3.01759421101314
" "you may depend upon my not mentioning it. 2.1091605708670245
while in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ! do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ? are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " "yes , and i had heard it before. 2.7422364905401064
when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , "this is from caroline bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal. 2.1818726643494797
miss lucas is married and settled. 2.33948257600418
after this day , jane said no more of her indifference. 2.4896367018425347
" elizabeth asked questions in vain ; maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate. 1.9997603400382737
Number. 2.2885629017403297
"your affectionate friend , "lydia bennet. 2.4287747390543295
miss darcy 's praise occupied the chief of it. 3.045801628361769
jane now came up. 2.7160995575794127
you deserve no such attention. 2.51652004767255
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same. 2.0927573391464662
" when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed. 2.737798421380705

" and taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william , "indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of dancing. 3.218101160101109
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenelworth , birmingham , &c. 2.507599321319227
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. 2.7139373753608913
he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy. 2.243602739283156
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr darcy 's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road. 2.1979578411602287
i speak nothing but the truth. 2.612497004004313
will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying (what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him. 2.2149830354354423
" during their walk , it was resolved that Mr bennet 's consent should be asked in the course of the evening. 2.8299219183174045
"i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried jane. 2.067301926918225
for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? " "oh ! " cried elizabeth , "i am excessively diverted. 2.1250852145905226
Mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity. 1.9020022470968239
but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. 2.1970942356066545
Mr gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase. 2.0275185133112057
" "an excellent consolation in its way , " said elizabeth , "but it will not do for us. 2.5529301279725245
i never heard any harm of her ; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. 4.385201145376959
his affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. 2.288575903702653
" "there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. 2.2289226712773176
" "these are heavy misfortunes , " replied elizabeth. 2.8578590378824758
ring the bell , kitty , for hill. 2.641906296392841
Mr bennet protested against any description of finery. 2.4920149133701237
it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself. 1.906122667069977
such a countenance , such manners ! and so extremely accomplished for her age ! her performance on the piano forte is exquisite. 1.7911069454516733
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. 1.7331826569725688
but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation. 2.1335582504870763
she liked him too little to care for his approbation. 2.231570796702952
but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object. 3.317125111990171
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; Mr darcy looked up. 2.0779423233020147
this was very amiable , but charlotte 's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of ; its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of Mr collins 's addresses , by engaging them towards herself. 1.7898848663875073
elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the compliment must be all for herself. 2.0893905779108954
his marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy. 2.05280930622102
she felt anew the justice of Mr darcy 's objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend. 2.398624763837931
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life. 2.1910020379667228
they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry. 2.224946062247266
her ladyship 's carriage is regularly ordered for us. 2.8143873228252225
he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it. 4.630631472767731
as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire ; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination. 2.6959029621889092
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence ; she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty. 1.9875807929390874
" "my fingers , " said elizabeth , "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women 's do. 2.6796342476687713
let her go then. 2.972940455905106
to the rest of the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mrs bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others. 2.4647256877338486
i hate such false friends. 2.830527182621542
" to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent Mr bingley 's being there ; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his. 2.3339533812109714
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , "i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal. 1.7333220607217041
they solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister. 1.9534085281805016
what i have to say relates to poor lydia. 3.0937602824625157
"you used us abominably ill , " answered Mrs hurst , "in running away without telling us that you were coming out. 1.9757691856998005
but Mrs bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which would exactly finish jane 's week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. 2.033033092564531
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes. 2.4246339477765435
i need not explain myself farther ; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable. 1.8885776238026895
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. 2.1048733101552117
" "compared with some families , i believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means. 1.8436218423741868
" "your plan is a good one , " replied elizabeth , "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it. 2.673662938676337
haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week. 3.0652458570509373
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if i was her , i would not have put up with it. 2.4330724816951963
it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. 2.8630191250084467
he had rather hoped that all his wife 's views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear. 2.0992947028679754
you know i have. 2.8174967798409747
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose. 2.278239106223532
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother. 3.581105133658984
for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father 's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. 2.3955328897823116
elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it. 2.9545969805397987
" darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. 1.9125459195297334
" "why will you think so ? it must be his own doing. 2.4299116669617797
i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr darcy. 1.9533926394516852
" "i beg your pardon , " replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer. 2.6567869336575
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered. 2.14737770487471
" elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. 2.1392296167380973
it is not quite a week since they left brighton. 2.343004585582164
" "i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried elizabeth. 2.346036212537135
had lydia 's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that Mr darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned. 1.920365149811616
about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her. 1.8940715923412803
his surprise was great. 2.778790080772726
i know it to be impossible. 2.74948355440706
but that is not the case here. 3.0426323886711186
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all Number states of the united states. 2.239971290404974
" "we are not in a way to know what Mr bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , "since we are not to visit. 3.012747362903885
you have liked many a stupider person. 2.8737080939257376
she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend. 2.0465740056298896
pray read on. 2.988482462011215
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. 1.8378562460987284
though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you. 2.293081068147422
but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant. 2.560397165243278
" "she is a very fine looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well. 1.8705821099637627
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard. 2.019217016612984
" "yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded. 2.250037635495026
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither ; but charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. 2.228469317808173
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley 's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. 2.2681894062271244
i must speak to hill , this moment. 2.7311229332717937
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived. 2.2589243000275943
she dared not relate the other half of Mr darcy 's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. 2.311923587920262
be assured , my dear sir , that Mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. 2.2055632678511796
their reception from Mr bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial. 3.6337378728293532
" miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour. 2.9299118468518044
his sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards Mr darcy with a very expressive smile. 2.9045570601572743
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire. 2.558774635923919
what did colonel forster say ? had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? they must have seen them together for ever. 1.8704392364015094
at present i am not in love with Mr wickham ; no , i certainly am not. 3.148505170500251

she answered him with cold civility. 2.4762423264863815
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of Mr darcy. 2.0694582793508283
" 'tis too much ! " she added , "by far too much. 2.556803649057032

no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. 2.173420626733761
balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters. 2.2615423844998244
" in a few days Mr bingley returned Mr bennet 's visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. 2.309452340412757
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world. 1.9315657323969475
"yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , "i remember hearing you once say , Mr darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable. 2.891802565485268
" "let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility. 2.087509315824869
" "i will not trust myself on the subject , " replied wickham , " i can hardly be just to him. 2.437992653918061
i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at. 1.8481180399437647

Mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking , mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together. 2.164535858746232
but it is all , all too late now. 3.1161274262556344
at first there seemed danger of lydia 's engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular. 2.0481822780584875
he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all. 3.520233560706416
your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr collins , and i will never see you again if you do. 2.4309775467862433
" "unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do. 2.2182491752352034
it was the second week in may , in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street , for the town of - in hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr bennet 's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman 's punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs. 2.930476110099862
" this information made elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor miss bingley. 2.283229969037611
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty. 2.085595737870697
the particulars , i reserve till we meet. 2.3697738250867038
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour 's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment. 1.832514525017974
" Mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. 2.33084763678818
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. 120.87904013036562
if , indeed , it should be so ! but i dare not hope it. 4.002158791161332
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. 2.6684264539189404
" jane looked at her doubtingly. 3.350382185860073
" nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance. 2.000039791681603
could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ? his temptation is not adequate to the risk. 1.9235292604750316
but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. 2.1106586961980334
he added , that Mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave london , and promised to write again very soon. 3.2649724909518394
" "nay , if you are so serious about it , i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled. 2.8191375004309065
they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long. 2.2533125082273258
but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited. 2.2524220934669277
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere. 1.9543957721548053
i have a high respect for your nerves. 2.3003744413782736
each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their mother talked on , of her dislike of Mr darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr bingley 's friend , without being heard by either of them. 2.5894841832837296
Mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it. 2.1489391496152153
she felt it so ; and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained. 2.1325334672740675
" "my motive for cautioning you , is as follows. 2.345059686923847
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one 's own daughters i cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr collins too ! why should he have it more than anybody else ? " "i leave it to yourself to determine , " said Mr bennet. 1.9170916950186272
your 's , &c. 2.4607598654754557
" Mrs bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of bingley 's behaviour to jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals. 2.2903379665466232
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel. 2.331499678790181
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia 's situation , hastily exclaimed , "i beg your pardon , but i must leave you. 2.052934143836982

my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness , and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due. 2.1829164401512453
" away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech. 1.9065558680898373
miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful. 2.3428100095435997
eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress. 2.116781299470656
when the party broke up , lydia returned with Mrs forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning. 2.1223133340617593
" they were all astonished ; and Mr bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , "but is there not danger of lady catherine 's disapprobation here , my good sir ? you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness. 2.0461978453467853
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you. 2.1762854082820335
of Mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find. 2.7011885713052255
jane listened with astonishment and concern ; she knew not how to believe that Mr darcy could be so unworthy of Mr bingley 's regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham. 3.1278905401110646
sir william did not say much. 2.700337733489062
elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings. 2.3653674043719746
i am going away myself. 3.0396535471998343
he knows where we live. 2.9692544461062553
well , how pleased i am ! and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now. 2.354070497322661
that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations. 2.169848911288919
lady catherine , sir william , and Mr and Mrs collins sat down to quadrille ; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs jenkinson to make up her party. 2.5985248379934114
i came to try you. 2.543607076023879
- i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you. 2.580849655051567
e. 2.5002575954001145
but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham 's resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate. 1.8654127142159578
Mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well. 2.0412999866261696
"there is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said kitty ; "who can it be ? " "some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose ; i am sure i do not know. 2.825170172016514
"indeed , jane , you ought to believe me. 2.900484522813763
" "how strange ! " cried elizabeth. 2.7972864101323114
that he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating. 4.791508763704975
as a clergyman , moreover , i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. 1.9601326334496398
e. 2.5002575954001145
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling. 2.5202864705153565
the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants. 1.989967255495907
how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family ! when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham 's character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful. 2.060125080912796
"oh , yes ! he was to come there with wickham , you know. 3.509378377528545
it was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , "say nothing of that. 2.2066571686673147
" "i dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age. 2.474266235094412
she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. 2.026162519957049
i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. 2.1675562817429994
" "yes , very different. 2.685758152400228
will you come and see me ? " "we shall often meet , i hope , in hertfordshire. 2.727859580528365
it is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. 2.6975887160886245
" "ten thousand pounds ! heaven forbid ! how is half such a sum to be repaid ? " Mr bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house. 2.0934113743845026
"can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated. 2.8720687878588573
but , perhaps he could not in her mother 's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. 2.5368681242878126
" "perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often. 3.2589813794476226
"this was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! " said Mrs bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. 2.312362325700748
indeed , Mr darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear. 2.313651334292544
they were able to love each other , even as well as they intended. 2.5229722556879177
Mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away. 2.188520652400705
i am not equal to it. 2.864477033745745
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. 2.1577630512060595
her own thoughts were employing her. 2.5066165369439584
"you may readily comprehend , " she added , "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and (comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time. 2.7111074797341095
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas 's last week ; and even Mr darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least. 2.7185163019861687
" "i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , "that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness. 2.0707384230546557
it is very unlucky ; but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now. 2.1586380631726785
"you certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome. 2.2266398910677982
i told my sister philips so the other day. 2.924744317463317
our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly. 2.085387951356089
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. 2.9144100966399704
and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ? poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me. 2.300586060140189
for herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him. 2.4385577835929944
gardiner. 3.5054185443125223
the pause was to elizabeth 's feelings dreadful. 2.4979660251179427
i shall like it of all things. 2.5384046472582162
" "you appear to me , Mr darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. 2.4675234683048513
"this is a parade , " cried he , "which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! another day i will do the same ; i will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as i can , or , perhaps , i may defer it , till kitty runs away. 2.0820033634276878
at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family. 2.3666420232172403
it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast. 2.286676418702721
after wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought ; re considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation. 2.112010289417923
you have a sweet room here , Mr bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk. 2.430544563745207
i am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs f. 2.2692169693969007
his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother 's reproach prevented his feeling any regret. 2.524989196373147
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn ; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement. 2.9539531882274304
it was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long. 3.1488518185012095
his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind. 3.546581957508934
it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , "how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , Mr darcy ! it must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before. 2.242491367650477
"can you come to morrow ? " yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow ; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity. 2.102770542935819
my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last. 2.440401503801188
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. 1.8221647532698289
mary 's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; her voice was weak , and her manner affected. 2.1305408776550454
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister 's being in town. 3.0704314374613664
"my dearest lizzy will , i am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley 's regard for me. 2.2948286693515723
her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth 's wishes , for she was impatient to get home. 3.576562223532637
" "how can you talk so ? " said jane faintly smiling , - "you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate. 2.18841536145465
" "i am sure i shall break mine , " said lydia. 3.920800932505547

she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother 's right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , "ah ! jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman. 1.9973193971697183
they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs bennet 's civilities. 1.7257190674244465
adieu. 4.1514429520355325
"while i can have my mornings to myself , " said she , "it is enough. 2.4545905031449045
do you often dance at st. 2.3355000545454203
elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend. 2.629320902620977
after tea , Mr bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument. 2.8627596454804274
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn. 1.7376466175844034
Number. 2.2885629017403297
" "i certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said darcy , "of conversing easily with those i have never seen before. 2.2490487193004745
kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy. 2.27613172450629
" "oh ! your father of course may spare you , if your mother can. 2.2557903686348846
i should infinitely prefer a book. 2.350531187220632
" their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. 1.9872268717584358
as for your elizabeth 's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? " "it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied. 2.0949120618668426
" "let me write for you , " said jane , "if you dislike the trouble yourself. 2.434846225693602
if it be not so , let Mr darcy contradict it. 2.3321290199347726
" "the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies. 2.3622693705120823
she is grown so brown and coarse ! louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again. 2.454790677430986
miss bennet accepted her aunt 's invitation with pleasure ; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline 's not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him. 2.0612752715593268
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of Mr darcy 's civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister. 2.0941035089654605
it is of all subjects my delight. 2.405736411289082
e. 2.5002575954001145
but she had no reason to fear Mr and Mrs gardiner 's curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication. 2.7009941529010604
but , lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not. 2.2250784976990277
i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy. 2.3166024528670865
but what does he say of the living ? " "he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only. 2.7330221552465144
vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self destined to another. 1.9854214720494912
but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife. 1.8039820836718696
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise. 2.0391338604654687
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that she would not give into it. 2.427828336636069
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious. 2.4990991388351356
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards. 2.942642644367809
no arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent 's mind. 1.8945892755187854
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer ; and i have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know. 2.630121979434903
" nothing that she could say , however , had any influence. 3.981611305794904
"if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield , " said Mrs bennet to her husband , "and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for. 2.351663992333174
jane was so admired , nothing could be like it. 2.1980941900172115
he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister. 2.051624694945648
" elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to colonel fitzwilliam , "your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word i say. 2.129333370504632
 . 5.380752294984095
not one party , or scheme , or any thing. 2.297747509370782
he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. 2.478917010990107
this , she would not hear of ; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother 's proposal ; and it was settled that Mr jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better. 2.4162228323949693

elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. 1.9807502749665438
chapter xv. 3.1520790291911487
" "aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if i had known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. 2.286605119716693
we may compare our different opinions. 2.5635711877522422
" "oh ! yes , " said elizabeth drily " Mr darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him. 2.487097916680527
as for their mother , Mr collins 's letter had done away much of her ill will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters. 2.239458492924087
this was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming. 2.368557362118309
so , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next. 2.154371844672317
" "that is exactly what i should have supposed of you , " said elizabeth. 2.5946228001578167
i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. 2.261049853736605
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case. 2.712523990491535
he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. 2.013136695228018
if there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence. 3.214119688121787
the first part of Mrs gardiner 's business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. 2.0506561313986555
f. 2.7701078899210225
could she have seen half as much love in Mr darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes. 2.1245260253622162
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. 2.22568685800797
she was sorry that Mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister 's refusal must have given him. 2.1421728996396356
" "are they indeed ? " cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction. 2.8775527523451507
but she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. 1.7985943203215398
" she was gone directly. 2.993333931324139
they are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father 's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families. 2.6671441340517634
the visit was returned in due form. 2.403780514833714
are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? " "no really , " replied elizabeth ; "i think there cannot be too little said on the subject. 3.1054824731212087
" "it is well. 3.0779581421091744
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty. 2.959071242032396
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable. 1.8727676710732217
i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day. 3.4178663921497603

multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets (example : m ^ {rs } ). 2.5722530278421862
the day of his and lydia 's departure soon came , and Mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth. 2.1657609577039976
" "and you saw him frequently ? " "yes , almost every day. 2.192688549479459
" "perhaps i do. 2.7149370245093376
she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some accident been lost. 2.233285320767591
" "and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him. 2.943798151733994
his regiment is there ; for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars. 2.332260727992585
nothing could console and nothing appease her. 2.31494622729287
" occupied in observing Mr bingley 's attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. 2.5656762339102253
" "i can much more easily believe Mr bingley 's being imposed on , than that Mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony. 2.0535742363582714
let me advise you then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence. 2.3968980865450957
i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read. 2.5479420265680144
it had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; but when Mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy. 2.1485051127030554
" elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. 1.8598390100234965
"you are a good girl ; " he replied , "and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. 2.445850220287602

he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable. 2.542475111374754
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. 2.545415652153819
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady 's fair , flowing hand ; and elizabeth saw her sister 's countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. 2.145690134387988
lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her. 2.209405395356653
having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. 2.895417792344634
if he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go. 2.227319971262532
the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter. 2.3589237060795925
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth : "my dearest lizzy , "i find myself very unwell this morning , which , i suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. 2.405577635531136
you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its being created. 2.9708074461306584
they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them. 2.6021720599546083
" "really , Mr collins , " cried elizabeth with some warmth , "you puzzle me exceedingly. 3.0615796969261524
and so would anne , if her health had allowed her to apply. 2.046866858274255
it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you. 2.7629059055927216
" "and quite alone ? have all her friends left her ? " " Mrs annesley is with her. 1.9665714776888124
i am not qualified to form one. 2.372922857547997
Mrs gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. 2.5906267558878477
people do not die of little trifling colds. 2.3844097644020366
"edw. 3.213965111580634
" "such as vanity and pride. 2.4873537894757027
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good. 2.453371094093237
" "and do you like her ? " "very much. 2.3603996284821713
nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy. 2.2297608572875895
by this time she is actually with them ! if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! " "we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said jane : "i hope and trust they will yet be happy. 1.7889211081446557
e. 2.5002575954001145
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. 1.9309161359326645
"you quite mistook Mr darcy. 3.3825702114308718
at length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave. 2.8458400177954393
but the gloom of lydia 's prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she received an invitation from Mrs forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton. 2.0161070487242783
" miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. 1.851256501251909
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information. 2.2627072756317
Mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day. 1.954519042582429
there was no help for it however. 2.4698438619709564
you see how continually we are engaged there. 2.2766600374801884
" elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card table , and stationed herself between Mr bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game. 1.9801721392590617
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , "i have never had a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old. 2.131363533402801
"only think of its being three months , " she cried , "since i went away ; it seems but a fortnight i declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. 1.9534046729675947
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits. 2.557713025464713
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word. 2.5762427381896202
but they did pass away , and Mr and Mrs gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn. 2.1357664889263464
both sisters were uncomfortable enough. 2.5208248088879897
" "aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to. 3.0468386512874828
"how nicely we are crammed in ! " cried lydia. 2.5988224470078602
i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. 1.8358234760070353
a scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation. 1.779221513072513
" " that is his notion of christian forgiveness ! the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte 's situation , and his expectation of a young olive branch. 2.345084778556163
" "let me be rightly understood. 2.3466979229566682
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing 's park , when he put his letter into her hand ! she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it. 1.9286054848093988
Mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk. 1.9221854454576248
it was lady catherine de bourgh. 2.788568622041524
i am the happiest creature in the world. 2.668763541280279
till i can forget his father , i can never defy or expose him. 2.8980669789205797
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure ; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother 's admiration. 2.0156715011375237
but you have chosen your fault well. 2.321148241395645
" elizabeth could bear it no longer. 2.565641886985051
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. 2.024372769234258
" but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer. 2.509407449391966
come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia 's folly. 2.685703973290763
if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. 4.299689165042037
elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , "you mean to frighten me , Mr darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. 2.1793994125816236
it will save me a world of trouble and economy. 1.9991055681653036
"you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing. 2.4188157963358177
came on into hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in barnet and hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through. 3.216045567931411
" "miss bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , "you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with. 3.024746611766891
they were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of pemberley might be something ! they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned. 2.0698190362495734
these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay. 2.7312812958514274
my sister , i am sure , will not hear of her removal. 2.945980551565288
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " "your ladyship has declared it to be impossible. 1.925584090634706
elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him. 2.2155883646338994
here you are in your own family. 2.601948529409529
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united states. 1.7415167408957681
at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw Mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. 2.56986948920987
oh ! why is not every body as happy ? " elizabeth 's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express. 1.7786460113186875
the situation of your mother 's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father. 1.9254489517815616
no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called. 2.1331227544557043
* * * * * "good gracious ! " cried Mrs bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , "if that disagreeable Mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley ! what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company. 2.147973205573218
you shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness. 1.8328471016119467
they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn ; and i understand from Mrs gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the south. 2.334483929652675
it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two. 2.4024654027811243
colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body. 2.294684423152522
neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Mr darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach. 2.0113640130572463
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. 2.0148066741252384
we neither of us perform to strangers. 2.48820995950134
she looked at jane , to see how she bore it ; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley. 2.2986042630337877
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they should meet. 3.5899356716703847
i congratulate her. 3.0011671770183916
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr wickham with money. 2.1632227329986797
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up. 2.116353239426965

if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement , you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph Number. 1.7893502581379213
it mortifies me. 3.0829393124103026
" "we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , " said elizabeth. 1.9722209244986049
they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself. 2.602538640855665
" "you mistake me , my dear. 2.739503473248967
every girl in , or near meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites. 2.3201265144534813
good girl ! it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley 's pretended regard. 4.558047603739265
i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner. 2.0083008822407864
i expected you to stay two months. 2.315860563474966
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress. 1.7616027234861107
but she would not be secure. 3.7502683861406436
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , "in vain have i struggled. 1.8034285923872335
"my dear brother , "at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope will give you satisfaction. 2.1648293337594944
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself. 2.0673319816545703
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty ; and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , "go to your father , he wants you in the library. 2.8564985449663904
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. 1.9789576087908936
his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. 1.8641320921256388
e. 2.5002575954001145
james 's ? " "never , sir. 3.255995048443286
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. 2.3095258505891567
he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us. 2.500892125818373
he was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. 2.631401384509524
" "the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so. 2.3300960597498928
she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her. 3.640252572970969
they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. 1.9648478486462073
her reflections were in general satisfactory. 2.426811000794359
" "but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham. 2.057898395157202
but no such recollection befriended her. 2.750930645160803
they shook hands with great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of jane 's perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself. 3.145599618611405
sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance. 2.0606108980824716
with such rivals for the notice of the fair , as Mr wickham and the officers , Mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. 2.2442974303328467
there was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. 2.298110038120887
" "but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out. 2.16863216375895
with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Mr wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. 2.36900911578086
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment. 2.5702665524553536
"where is your sister ? " said he hastily , as he opened the door. 2.7685603302473156
" "are you , indeed ? and pray what sort of guardians do you make ? does your charge give you much trouble ? young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way. 1.6928878647255432
she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but i will make her know it. 2.3099712235193164
Number. 2.2885629017403297
"could i expect it to be otherwise ! " said she. 2.928217296539792
" "she had better have stayed at home , " cried elizabeth ; "perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one 's neighbours. 2.005572926036455
if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement , you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg tm electronic works in your possession. 2.0746856986040974
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once. 2.085796329644413
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately. 2.29974137181737
they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. 2.2765180333335895
Mr collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed. 2.269036521279827
Mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant 's commission in the shire. 2.3228430689243895
the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again. 2.1975903799265044
then , the two third he danced with miss king , and the two fourth with maria lucas , and the two fifth with jane again , and the two sixth with lizzy , and the boulanger " "if he had had any compassion for me , " cried her husband impatiently , "he would not have danced half so much ! for god 's sake , say no more of his partners. 3.1096692088438367
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do. 2.133704881899036
Mr wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which Mr darcy just deigned to return. 2.2869696863026197
from elizabeth 's thoughts it was never absent. 2.2221060614699404
it cannot be done too much ; and when i next write to her , i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. 2.412221502020282
" lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence. 1.936741475708875
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for Mr collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton. 2.056197360233072
there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste. 1.9257453281206525
" "will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again ? at present i have not room to do them justice. 1.9045504420936965
" "and can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? " "i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. 2.1195819972079804
our situation with regard to lady catherine 's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. 2.0453563381205306
Mr wickham 's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and Mr collins 's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. 3.118514273044888
" "good heavens ! " cried elizabeth ; "but how could that be ? how could his will be disregarded ? why did not you seek legal redress ? " "there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. 2.3669068818395007
in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ? all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry. 2.15896389001767
" she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where Mr hurst had a house. 1.8188908869492004
i am sure you must feel it so. 2.691681562666398
at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward. 2.2662766382971853
after sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to elizabeth , "i hope you are well , miss bennet. 3.365754377112287
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments. 1.8654287181511033
i roused , and interested you , because i was so unlike them. 2.3166842831066203

" "how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year ! letters of business too ! how odious i should think them ! " "it is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours. 2.524303321672793
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. 1.9133737295757398
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while Mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor. 2.332928904623326
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london. 2.391532567039353
" with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. 1.9472074656986458
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to elizabeth , said , "miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room. 2.3017779314274236
a military life is not what i was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible. 1.7927276797894043
if she does not object to it , why should we ? " " her not objecting , does not justify him. 2.1072320993280216
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life. 2.2188353903029916
" "you shall have it in few words. 2.159015841825983
" she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. 1.9107926100512713
" elizabeth smiled. 2.931892632782813
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton. 2.1655000441332173
if Mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ? " "because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it. 1.7773896344647073
no thanks to his gallantry for that. 2.295283644543899
had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr darcy , the gardener 's expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it. 1.9271589658037667
' those were your words. 2.4956802053774894
there is a lady , it seems , a Mrs younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what. 2.367731909215689
"and is this all ? " cried elizabeth. 2.7061976787429702
if you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. 1.9808191248917788
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! " "oh ! jane , " cried elizabeth , "was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? " "i do not know. 2.5137606173208358
what relates to yourself , is as follows. 2.5421270977390984
"well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , "what say you to the day ? i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you. 2.1154539669146883
lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself. 2.7721741369819926
darcy , after enquiring of her how Mr and Mrs gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing. 2.090437091861875
"your 's sincerely , &c. 2.7783103083667515
its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn. 2.2922420950348013
give me farther particulars. 3.3829016962801015
" and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. 2.6064179351726966
that tall , proud man. 2.4860102857437916
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said , "i was surprised to see darcy in town last month. 2.3918435682122174
"who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? " "his misfortunes ! " repeated darcy contemptuously ; "yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed. 1.7679607284181822
the dejection was almost universal. 2.819959034590477
" Mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments. 3.5730201311971426
if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him. 1.9438701111576908
you could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine. 2.7553948999919604
since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design. 2.0650268593206853
she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , "when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance. 2.338025903333836
&c. 3.802139919987643
" "i would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried bingley , "for a kingdom ! upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as i have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty. 2.217874713722591
there was also a postscript to this effect. 2.268220612292705
elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives. 2.0763045608537456
two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them. 2.064418268450623
you will be a very happy woman. 3.1281693937782538
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence , strict liability , breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph Number. 2.485126577364935
on being made acquainted with the present Mr darcy 's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman 's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard Mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy. 2.1946800078421167
bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. 2.275848727371861
he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. 2.151412568036393
but my feelings are not only cordial towards him ; they are even impartial towards miss king. 1.9592377224122914
i hope there was. 2.9889269832874907
Mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character. 1.9193635731017764
" "perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and Mr robinson ; did not i mention it to you ? Mr robinson 's asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question oh ! the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point. 1.9510421177468384
such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined. 2.0189577038736974
it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage. 3.2783509498878733

" it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now. 2.211880897087142
" "what should not you mind ? " "i should not mind any thing at all. 2.35558780851518
d. 3.213965111580634
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? " "will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? " "by all means , " cried bingley ; "let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of. 1.8156583637635193
they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream. 2.8694001342484623
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. 2.126446235792566
it was dated from rosings , at eight o 'clock in the morning , and was as follows : - "be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you. 2.0368528216333672
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had Mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all. 3.0201154531507504
do not you , darcy ? " "my style of writing is very different from yours. 2.237721707221993
on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate ; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided. 1.9703665754436783
now what have you to say ? " "only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me. 3.1965673657950386
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it. 2.3154438470296816
"i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man 's intimates in the regiment , whether wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. 2.022182436452268
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother 's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? catherine , weak spirited , irritable , and completely under lydia 's guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and lydia , self willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing. 2.1429100904282365
" "and that is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london ! my dear aunt , how could you think of it ? Mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month 's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr bingley never stirs without him. 2.2890611461203143
to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley. 2.2864494204560977
oh ! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! " wickham , lydia , were all forgotten. 1.9698512070152245
amongst the most violent against him was Mrs bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters. 2.16510148215572
for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey. 2.0586627109258133
" " Mr darcy , you see , is the man ! now , lizzy , i think i have surprised you. 2.6236414723302084
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe ; and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. 2.2204371194209878

it was all pride and insolence. 2.723735850790664
now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. 2.35074626069498
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character. 2.5603741060756553
you shall hear what she says. 2.4149193463098366

"my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way. 3.0882096439559144
while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came. 2.2601714844809844
" from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr darcy had been over rated , elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs gardiner 's long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : "i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , i was too cross to write. 2.0200499473060356
and what do you think she said besides ? 'ah ! Mrs bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last. 2.258611905734603
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. 2.910037607331408
" "oh ! " cried miss bingley , "charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. 3.598680097514074
at present we have nothing to guide us. 2.960532379274042
"lizzy , " said he , "i was going to look for you ; come into my room. 2.2542280329248063
you do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms. 2.219166653804924
" elizabeth 's astonishment was beyond expression. 2.5575020008140235
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? " "they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible. 2.480631591468099
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but elizabeth , less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte 's , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. 2.0318991675940072
" "and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added kitty. 2.1891320538130037
elizabeth was determined ; nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion. 1.8620242698626102
Mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months. 1.9572647685204863
lydia laughed , and said , "aye , that is just like your formality and discretion. 3.058412872871043
Mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family ; jane heard them with horror. 2.40602622056167
to Mrs gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers. 2.895198138262349
, but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations. 2.2327562311097457
two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. 3.331594005296496
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself. 2.919138206582574
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house. 2.018057300698623
" charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where Mrs bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family. 2.1398323621843804
she answered him in the usual way , and after a moment 's pause , added , "my eldest sister has been in town these three months. 2.781676227520493
if that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon. 2.8800996483835513
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady 's whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away. 2.627100975404316
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her. 2.4280295213234613
no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy. 1.7919611959084427
her colour changed , and she said no more. 2.90737898503315
you must contrive to send somebody. 2.679161261552358
but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable. 2.1603170223277988

i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies. 3.836862981697932
who could about such a nasty little freckled thing ? " elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal ! as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kitty 's and lydia 's purchases , were seated in it. 2.4120217783968374
james 's. 3.1752442300524804
this Mrs younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town. 2.375804425306362
"i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter. 1.8802219837098144

there is something very pompous in his style. 2.6243652809476483
that such a consequence as this should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts. 2.1801680934195433
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , Mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. 2.8945550902819783
you had much better dance. 2.7906281270222255
you mentioned two instances. 3.0178389658347755
my youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who i believe will soon become a part of the family. 2.73056863025059
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs gardiner 's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. 2.3647619785764067
ii. 4.076413670695765
in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. 2.6850531874008547
but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy Mr collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship 's praise into his own hands. 2.200297273460728
Mrs gardiner abused her stupidity. 2.5283369836290035
mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs bennet 's being quite unable to sit alone. 2.0414690435559977
" elizabeth could not but look surprised. 2.4950774925754753
any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr darcy about it , if you had rather not. 3.3223612772149647
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady 's attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. 1.9309049950841086
" "well , my dear , " said Mr bennet , when elizabeth had read the note aloud , "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr bingley , and under your orders. 2.6335825542286164
elizabeth was in agonies. 3.224364469196259
"lady catherine de bourgh , " she replied , "has very lately given him a living. 2.563111514109622
i thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name. 2.3296050251140183
i never saw such a long chin in my life. 2.7425606323135963
but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet. 2.234539116167195
"i am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs bennet , "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. 2.6453643880364606
on this subject , what can you have to say ? in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? " "you take an eager interest in that gentleman 's concerns , " said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour. 1.8987358803394143
" "i like her appearance , " said elizabeth , struck with other ideas. 2.313081657271722
with the gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms. 2.5251733153442513
the lucases are very artful people indeed , sister. 2.2844193132721022
you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us. 2.07049216109891
" elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. 2.202986412197073
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering ; and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks. 1.906713911575456
"i am sure there is not on his. 2.6612644451577183
lydia was a stout , well grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. 2.0226986935460256

she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else. 2.5209864964800635

but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , (who , however , may live many years longer , ) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years. 2.8966197573897983

it was a fortnight since Mrs bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high. 2.6542086158942255
"two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge. 2.4044633718464103

"it would be nothing ; i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. 2.308625685529351
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention. 2.0046519080934804
" she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door. 2.3176674749525557

" "and do you really know all this ? " cried Mrs gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive. 2.313172613758108
she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr darcy 's character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son. 2.61928872478157
" miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives. 2.5662153031204675
at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , "and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting ! i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , i am thus rejected. 2.10487824648362
it was in the times and the courier , i know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be. 3.184333713615472
"but it is , " returned she ; "for Mrs long has just been here , and she told me all about it. 2.28155507703754
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see Mr darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea. 1.9213383520709428
though lydia 's short letter to Mrs f. 2.6214236119717818
he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend. 1.9232440095223815
"she is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration. 2.9268073087417545
she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more. 3.332721486878542

" catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of captain carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to london. 2.5543163983340804

importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. 2.412688693685798
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family. 2.1705139302250336
"she is so fond of Mrs forster , " said she , "it will be quite shocking to send her away ! and there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much. 2.260841196327451

it was as follows : "my dear sir , "i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire. 2.0211781521253966

" "i am exceedingly gratified , " said bingley , "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. 1.893881124954646
" "if we thought alike of miss bingley , " replied jane , "your representation of all this , might make me quite easy. 2.3780792590807933
it is Mr wickham 's intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. 2.2392776755400714
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , "so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham ! your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late Mr darcy 's steward. 2.819332547749649
"yet why did he come ? " she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to him she had hardly courage to speak. 2.2755076095901754
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. 2.0360015780227876

Mr bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself. 2.0676537196150053
" Mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies ; and sir william , to elizabeth 's high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way. 2.9552754344918384

lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and Mr collins , in describing the civility of Mr and Mrs philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house. 2.135596227484633
lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath ; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley 's good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone. 1.797075006411766
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could. 2.2346535300373724

he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again. 2.908557848905614

he bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr darcy , with an expression of half laughing alarm. 2.462882637107672
lydia 's being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites. 2.1136876578391703

unfortunately an only son , (for many years an only child ) i was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , (my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. 2.485036805432597

georgiana 's reception of them was very civil ; but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved. 1.7437147826419237
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time. 2.097658099770067

Mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mrs bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. 2.060372380641621
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere. 1.9232134323806238

Mr wickham 's chief object was unquestionably my sister 's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement. 2.422783320408393

i will go directly to Mr bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure. 2.8294261975868675
you and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr bingley might like you the best of the party. 1.9895540256459225

Mr darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours. 2.585295273929202
i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her. 2.813907262323972

many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man. 2.083735420272495
allowing for the common demands of the game , Mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr darcy. 2.4661369015449695
she had obtained private intelligence that Mr darcy did not wish for cards ; and Mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. 1.927854741576838

by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain ; mary would not understand them ; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song. 1.980142203513814
how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd ! yet it did , and even a third. 2.088264257522711
this match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place. 2.7442871088865313
but the case is this. 2.65164410459889
do you play and sing , miss bennet ? " "a little. 2.4092924128480915
"your great men often are ; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds. 1.9021125483101204
"on the evening before my going to london , " said he "i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago. 2.5119125266792275

" "you may depend upon it , madam , " said miss bingley , with cold civility , "that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us. 2.4377279847438103
Mrs gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head. 1.8204413374127695
" she replied in the affirmative. 3.0242189532863963
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr bingley 's name had been last mentioned between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged. 2.1071892423490395
i have met with two instances lately ; one i will not mention ; the other is charlotte 's marriage. 2.4512309129667766
you alluded to something else. 2.4550245081536684
and what sort of young lady is she ? is she handsome ? " "she is a most charming young lady indeed. 2.473119931794641
jane was distressed. 3.008105252151792
i cannot do justice to his kindness. 2.4403865483530356
she directly replied , "you need not be frightened. 2.382379175409044
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. 2.7491088265401484
while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them. 2.018790832094447
he is gone to my father already. 2.7390494593349057
"while mary is adjusting her ideas , " he continued , "let us return to Mr bingley. 2.2227622390604216
they were , therefore , to go. 3.1560501551509907
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast. 2.162605850353004
he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided. 2.3869231985618495
" "from Mr collins ! and what can he have to say ? " "something very much to the purpose of course. 2.3732793117504847
i guessed as much. 3.1367914780604558
" "have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " "oh ! yes. 2.5028320678433618
but it is so strange ! " " yes that is what makes it amusing. 2.0953623656533296
she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night. 2.281470052780369
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought. 2.173713497053791
he studies too much for words of four syllables. 2.497413757720306
" "you may as well call it impertinence at once. 2.1894179237323934
the compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt. 3.4390895443582306
is not it so , Mrs bennet ? " "yes , or i will never see her again. 2.5741677349485355
she had ventured only one glance at darcy. 2.1468981810754206
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week. 2.7933814820484
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes , and said he feared w. 1.9296937010581818
it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain. 2.175592908487166
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him. 2.5544550570074054
she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks. 2.508899535448387
it was a rational scheme to be sure ! but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea. 1.8687645400223867
" "you have a house in town , i conclude ? " Mr darcy bowed. 2.5113152401867476
Mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. 2.133156890113056
" this was a sad omen of what her mother 's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be ; and elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations ' consent , there was still something to be wished for. 2.8413071669466463
his belief of her sister 's insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. 2.0949778439200317
the discussion of Mr collins 's offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother. 2.869231444025985
Mrs gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder. 2.9361585752572816
it is every way horrible ! " darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence. 2.2234908940033895
Number. 2.2885629017403297
she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found. 2.9481672589634336
but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you. 2.287111181002334
teaze him laugh at him. 2.5981583544299625
nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant. 2.889899479503908
but georgiana would not join her. 2.3232988998578485
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. 1.8843555444226046
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot. 1.8149665594784061
the pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. 3.0880631308235205
there was now employment for the whole party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table. 3.3470119535250573
you know how i detest it , unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner. 2.1415478982707534

" "but he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather 's death made her mistress of this fortune. 1.8542257163655123
let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to Mr darcy 's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated Mr darcy in a most infamous manner. 2.977747745552373
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while Mr darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth 's person , behaviour , and dress. 1.88061129023456
Mr bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene. 2.422699096969159
it was to this effect : "since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well. 2.0135610740845222
in the hall they parted. 2.7358347630262894
*end of the project gutenberg ebook pride and prejudice * * this file should be named Number Number. 2.5796527077534304
Mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham 's desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well. 2.487822476631832
they have some of the finest woods in the country. 2.953722773090067
respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. 2.014909099116792
but who was your mother ? who are your uncles and aunts ? do not imagine me ignorant of their condition. 2.0648172045284765
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley 's two sisters. 1.7463615242281596
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park. 3.4357969766090957
bingley is most unaffectedly modest. 2.84758623666218
" "you are over scrupulous surely. 2.579838576470854
the suspicions which had just arisen of Mr darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. 1.8180625085391102
but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own. 2.0675585515935078
her mother 's ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth 's mind ; and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family. 2.396179892678648
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd. 2.2903236380878025
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced. 2.1513058387215414
Mrs bennet 's eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , "well , jane , who is it from ? what is it about ? what does he say ? well , jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love. 2.0075169876334793

" "not as you represent it. 2.644819424931781
"it is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. 2.3764226843919136
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. 2.412058020009743
she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , "by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield ? i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure. 1.8724848052879475
i do not wish to avoid the walk. 3.4124822847437204
how is such a man to be worked on ? how are they even to be discovered ? i have not the smallest hope. 3.000999728570702
i am not romantic you know. 3.0829795610046022
but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure. 2.562575028500528
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but i hardly know what i have written. 3.175294642626831
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane. 2.1362564267214954
" "and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ? " "the indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting. 1.7055089595259822
- "can this be Mr darcy ! " thought she. 2.696681761911272
he looked serious as usual ; and she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley. 3.285010310332209
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject. 2.2053882721669247
you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and Mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. 2.130606068725058
but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her. 2.401320616048816
it was a journey of only twenty four miles , and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon. 2.7550480971682343
" "why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks. 2.1995082049421173
it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. 2.132574014156699
oh ! lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall i bear so much happiness ! " she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty. 2.096148409036615
" "i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. 1.9166294728498428
the next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour 's tête àtête with Mrs bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed on. 1.809801876695641
"i have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech. 2.917074215125937
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. 2.1001665442576263
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them. 1.9394006435013924
i should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship. 2.6188743810053707
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr bennet were dead. 2.2043981319194326
they could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant 's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for Mr darcy. 2.545203877424982
my poor father ! how he must have felt it ! " "i never saw any one so shocked. 2.9204724889195504
she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers. 2.2364792967583202
" "no , " said colonel fitzwilliam , "that is an advantage which he must divide with me. 2.5345164695383224
" "oh , yes. 2.9174524363610934
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted. 2.2768532325276984
you must not suspect me. 2.8966849608599756
" "that is as it happens. 2.5346101751296133
"and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over. 2.0371351056486886
i pity , though i cannot help blaming her. 2.6421930535278735
"they have both , " said she , "been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea. 2.494002568965442
their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , Mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr and Mrs gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country. 2.3580094116826444
"that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance. 2.1571918589961068
we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way. 2.3461230364796206
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning 's impatience. 2.2999483648815207
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley 's inattention. 2.6495052547525364
smiles decked the face of Mrs bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy. 2.079500199632758
" "in point of composition , " said mary , "his letter does not seem defective. 2.7637914885348573
but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due. 2.164302822620338
wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. 2.1087995374650115
"when is your next ball to be , lizzy ? " "to morrow fortnight. 2.7083217167420734
i have a warm , unguarded temper , and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely. 3.4808487455963864
the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you. 2.0381271807749974
" but jane could think with certainty on only one point , that Mr bingley , if he had been imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public. 2.2455551540770493

we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word. 2.7224737163194788
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. 2.793944500817456
"e. 3.213965111580634
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. 2.2262671185394223
Mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last Mr collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility. 2.082998963966079
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied. 2.59425066248632
but i am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! they were excessively sorry to go ! but so they always are. 1.905049274051283
my affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever. 2.2185691259621563
her carriage remained at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it. 2.5175739455599144
chapter xxiii. 2.3092967987984188
" "i see no occasion for that. 2.54685345275784
" then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , "unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex. 1.9326670844305474
"good heaven ! can it be really so ! yet now i must believe you , " cried jane. 2.1683686391367827
" elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required. 2.4247039415925284
" "what is it you mean ? " "it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady 's family , it would be an unpleasant thing. 2.1307378979766556
"haye park might do , " said she , "if the gouldings would quit it , or the great house at stoke , if the drawing room were larger ; but ashworth is too far off ! i could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for purvis lodge , the attics are dreadful. 2.3114014575617343
i assure you , that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it. 2.5742730281172137
" Mrs gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of jane and elizabeth 's correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation. 2.4258020271872778
have you seen any pleasant men ? have you had any flirting ? i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. 2.0778717297433373
" "miss bingley told me , " said jane , "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance. 2.2586164159905615
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness. 2.538286844611081
they walked on , without knowing in what direction. 2.515697408379882
her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness. 2.234418302095168
her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it. 2.29113618363316
are you going much farther ? " "no , i should have turned in a moment. 2.4042609333368827
i know how much you dislike him. 2.5276004197731026
"and of this place , " thought she , "i might have been mistress ! with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted ! instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. 2.00427300988887
i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it ; i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason. 1.8822351039427614
he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask. 2.469342520815415
Mr darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. 2.2023243496529528
when the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother 's rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party. 2.385130678585501
" lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , "i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit. 2.020180502671465
Mrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia 's interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book ; but Mr collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with Mr bennet , and prepared for backgammon. 2.3486558751305635
" "good gracious ! Mr darcy ! and so it does i vow. 2.4619911574304685
you are not well enough ; you cannot go yourself. 2.8625332568169033
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty. 1.737766229061814
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion 's justifying her coming so far alone. 2.142830992252661
he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. 2.770782110464157
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical. 2.7054073939061856
Mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them. 2.082630912729797
" "ah ! " cried Mrs bennet , shaking her head , "then she is better off than many girls. 2.2510258674283543
" "what do you mean ? " "why , i must confess , that i love him better than i do bingley. 2.8480736346918927
but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. 1.9727595171680925
it was all over before i arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your ' s seems to have been. 2.132093348724149
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure. 2.1486520205898056
elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr darcy. 2.576206877312857
" "it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said bingley. 2.583821652987176
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully. 2.7031423592288997
Mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do. 1.9434096268989822
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet Mr darcy. 2.2456786986437125
their fortune on both sides is splendid. 2.3869961041973995
but do not imagine that he is always here so often. 2.536280474721818
"it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , "but at the same time , Mr bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. 2.6758499456327263
you are to understand , miss bennet , that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will i be dissuaded from it. 2.141460370932479
"a gamester ! " she cried. 3.1716887424430724
in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. 2.2525235184632932
the tête àtête surprised them. 2.614270299430359
long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided. 2.2199984146211786
as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Mr darcy , and Mr darcy only , entered the room. 2.1668063623892855
i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy. 2.914670702927473
your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather. 2.0524355359672457
elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased. 2.2525530525053297
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. 2.3534371572896364
if elizabeth , when Mr darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. 2.327119226531972
"i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her. 3.0698851258299906
you are charmingly group 'd , and appear to uncommon advantage. 2.890332647351393
at length however Mrs bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. 2.3206012101703197
"i do not blame jane , " she continued , "for jane would have got Mr bingley , if she could. 2.8032257636610445
i cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago. 2.58168920073501
e. 2.5002575954001145
why jane you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! well , i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see Mr bingley. 2.3122525813791395
he came to tell Mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once. 2.3047565135263954
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was miss lucas so kind as to listen to Mr collins. 2.8549502081733724
i believe i have now told you every thing. 2.4348406466375674
" "indeed i could not. 3.321325711856942
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street. 2.032320751440673
i dearly love a laugh. 2.49526882226846
i know we dine with four and twenty families. 2.041822030218929
- you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly. 2.696877920657265
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications. 2.714865005732389
' allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. 2.4663819804487157
" "you make me laugh , charlotte ; but it is not sound. 2.515302529261332
" but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley 's being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. 2.1117377650932183
"you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age. 2.2069441381514427
elizabeth went away with her head full of him. 2.176103086039533
this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed. 2.5328084760911764
i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall i own that i long for your return ? i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient. 2.3605397017110277
for forty years , he produced and distributed project gutenberg tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. 2.7114878682506123
indeed he has no improper pride. 2.692150885099356
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had miss lydia bennet come upon the town ; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house. 3.177865491634276
" "may i ask to what these questions tend ? " "merely to the illustration of your character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity. 2.694169435108967
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. 2.3888394662029366
i should say , one of her ladyship 's carriages , for she has several. 2.6540444525965707
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself. 2.444868078040273
besides , there was truth in his looks. 2.6927219004356884
after sitting a little while with jane , on miss bingley 's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. 2.445059955042633
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion. 3.147420592299993
he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london. 3.1569548990624092
" the colour now rushed into elizabeth 's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , "you look conscious. 1.943011169645322
" elizabeth 's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour 's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure. 2.7439557378406314
but i am at his disposal. 2.639108525487161
i am most seriously displeased. 2.642174905550997
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday. 2.077247919966387
and so , my dear sister , i find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley. 2.583300285745686
it was Mr collins 's picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened ; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest. 2.6584416288631334
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain. 2.4436694036834496
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants. 2.1318744360608077
were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him ; but now , as bingley 's friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me. 1.9856152993318112
"if he wants our society , let him seek it. 2.3723313513848012
you must come and make lizzy marry Mr collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her. 2.352654603003843
she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it. 2.46939503846404
never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f. 2.343738998371847
"we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said Mrs gardiner , "but perhaps to the lakes. 2.26000161384795
she was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she hardly knew of what. 2.75346849985594
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me. 2.047284095312426
" "but you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit. 2.2612986687543173
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland. 2.3202230455079045
Mrs bennet 's best comfort was , that Mr bingley must be down again in the summer. 2.232902225810636
there can be no occasion for your going so soon. 2.3765060576237245
" "gracechurch street , monday , august Number. 2.681521472469414
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak. 2.389544722980504
the note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with. 2.0192761225429328
but i will no longer importune my young cousin. 2.287947018531784
elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. 2.5204347003650533
wholly inattentive to her sister 's feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one 's congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish. 2.055205842725966
Mr collins 's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs bennet. 2.2924383163176114
"i should never have said Mrs collins was settled near her family. 2.5192312651205175
" "that is the most unforgiving speech , " said elizabeth , "that i ever heard you utter. 2.5643076170454977
stop me whilst you can. 2.7904294927173106
" "certainly , sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. 2.44202546604148
charles , when you build your house , i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley. 2.208315324809776
your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with. 2.499952535271497
and i think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece 's. 1.8772638442019605
i cannot think of it without abhorrence. 2.658069266796608
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from lady catherine. 2.1855518308684228
on the strength of darcy 's regard bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion. 3.120142325461115
well , any friend of Mr bingley 's will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him. 1.9546926932934265
but if we do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , i will take it on myself. 2.607586802183804
i will have no reserves from you. 2.941343347625216
" while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. 1.9558021486711152
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance. 2.1123581788944805
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions. 3.3840283923087533
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. 2.2180773178410704
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. 2.3805462046277235
she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. 3.3454163156238144
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. 2.410255281379105
we have not met since the Numberth of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield. 2.091291564147981
i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. 2.028301307622669
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " "oh , yes ! you will only think i feel more than i ought to do , when i tell you all. 2.3137054359714586
"but it is not merely this affair , " she continued , "on which my dislike is founded. 2.407098742127218
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior. 1.7602958404298954
i hope you have destroyed the letter. 2.9184367175150943
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way. 2.7884274467276495
" again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. 2.5507446839582255
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected. 2.4423949275435577
i feel as if i had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve. 1.938250062227669
he repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence. 2.1759716616172873
colonel fitzwilliam 's manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings. 2.4317614365784967
they will ruin your happiness. 2.4659654449145956
" "i must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied jane , "and i hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together. 2.347553519414365
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen. 1.8437590042575203
there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard. 2.697994226926769
she related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain. 3.85164222657971
i do not know who is good enough for him. 2.3053289489550783
f. 2.7701078899210225
he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , "it is above eight months. 2.181506708492529
the path just admitted three. 2.4413528108677616
he was on one side of her mother. 2.937119003436716
- "whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment. 2.0865046815652732
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed. 1.9606447636001096
" while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning. 1.9343780808333464
"i hope , my dear , " said Mr bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , "that you have ordered a good dinner to day , because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party. 3.1564443532966195

yet , indeed , i am in earnest. 3.9050746449316485
" "and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma 'am ? " "yes , very handsome. 2.3394182410707303

all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. 2.6920818439813208
i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite 's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better. 1.6949679088332568
s. 3.2308717412205743
elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight. 1.9853228251966908
thank heaven ! he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves. 2.0208534179189663
her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for Mr gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little. 2.2059097505828014
how does georgiana get on , darcy ? " Mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister 's proficiency. 2.429309747671819
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? " elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning. 2.3042674675498676
" it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. 2.5961753124123534
" "if you will thank me , " he replied , "let it be for yourself alone. 2.0801838032395863
it would have been strange if they had. 2.685863972619556
elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation. 2.9546878366052267
you could not make me happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so. 2.9301273063528486
" he then told her of georgiana 's delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend. 1.8445694932157806
" "all young ladies accomplished ! my dear charles , what do you mean ? " "yes , all of them , i think. 2.719137145547204
" "oh ! then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. 2.131494345945392
the strangeness of Mr collins 's making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. 2.31900042305012
about the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon. 2.2007601344845042
but there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me. 2.7488575215443634
"yes , she called yesterday with her father. 2.5824236723585807
&c. 3.802139919987643
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet i think it is well expressed. 2.140694040911185
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline 's interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one. 2.2559025877777117
i described , and enforced them earnestly. 3.2741057411478254

she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage ; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself , some shelves in the closets up stairs. 2.2204559957881598

elizabeth 's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. 2.0622775945655465

"from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry. 2.064364458728932

the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister 's match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. 1.775477451605456
"there is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , "who more particularly wishes to be known to you , will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ?

" elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham 's so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire. 3.1238472629463625

elizabeth now began to revive. 3.001585872989028
" as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane. 2.1248121766722416
" "oh ! where , where is my uncle ? " cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and Mr darcy appeared. 3.165222478939581
as long as she stays there , it is all very well. 4.289391251470726

but our visitor was very obstinate. 3.164723038692933
as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; and he soon afterwards said aloud , " Mr bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day ? " "i advise Mr darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , " said Mrs bennet , "to walk to oakham mount this morning. 2.4887030906098713
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. 2.5497413440913648
" to catherine and lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. 2.1259446646529403
" Mrs bennet 's eyes sparkled. 3.237911787133814
it pains me to offend you. 2.7140354170139225
her mind was less difficult to develope. 2.506267036474574
" to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia. 2.035983721938829
Mrs gardiner 's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : "you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly. 2.162780291516422
in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger. 2.331816990691773
they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy 's father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring. 2.278076366563766
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room. 2.31718508785212
" "tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? " though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a moment 's deliberation , "i am not. 2.1853721926230145
no , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if i have very good luck , i may meet with another Mr collins in time. 3.18780164761257
miss bingley was engrossed by Mr darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her. 2.1705747253723655
" most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote. 1.969204487331211
darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure. 1.823635148191518
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet 's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here. 2.462651895594903
there was too much to be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects. 2.509139012103902
on saturday he came again. 3.0049132697438643
i certainly have had my share of beauty , but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. 2.5027376201945306
it is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us. 3.225522011683214
"you are quite a visit in my debt , Mr bingley , " she added , "for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned. 2.1875555072814645
"about a month ago i received this letter , and about a fortnight ago i answered it , for i thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention. 1.8783497643150326
" "how should you have liked making sermons ? " "exceedingly well. 2.2882822423085787
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. 1.8847251334484807

the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent. 2.5199514460519143
" "yes , very well. 2.6572766240654926
and then when we came away it was such fun ! i thought we never should have got into the coach. 1.8644483004286587
"there has been many a one , i fancy , overcome in the same way. 2.2184300477287047
"as soon as ever Mr bingley comes , my dear , " said Mrs bennet , "you will wait on him of course. 3.1299042510218205
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield. 2.1899136898371454
he found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty. 2.547426572519427
the discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly. 2.0777837343442447
e. 2.5002575954001145
her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of Mr darcy 's indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much. 2.2427913207791668
on the very last day of the regiment 's remaining in meryton , he dined with others of the officers at longbourn ; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam 's and Mr darcy 's having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former. 2.645354389083832
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place. 2.4980626816712634
"i do not know when i have been more shocked , " said she. 3.802343634887175
* * * * * Mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. 2.207857464210252
elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes. 2.358497184971041
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning. 2.3321667130633
such very superior dancing is not often seen. 2.188258534377979
she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when. 2.743804904469344
so , do not put yourself to inconvenience. 2.566898558905769
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away. 2.2981168516733375
she is all affability and condescension , and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. 2.249344621118261
gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green , something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w. 2.2047681987000085
among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. 2.653989660797531
against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow Mr bingley 's carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made. 2.048247874583122
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs hurst or miss bingley ; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "lord , how tired i am ! " accompanied by a violent yawn. 2.4857698226032827
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. 2.072257619975072
" "but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied darcy. 26.96438786101391
it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground. 2.052544408222568
" Mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. 2.087116135940079
" when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend 's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr bingley for his sister. 2.479267093683192
"he only told me , what i have now told you. 2.7374506710436948
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor. 2.572162899859691
" "but does lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ? " "oh , yes ! that , that is the worst of all. 1.9001122188292847
bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them. 2.677944928366047
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate. 2.4604619020425473
" "if you mean darcy , " cried her brother , "he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards. 2.2095770485284865
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. 2.001903049337511
it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane 's attractions. 2.2680680007338467
" "no , that i am sure i shall not ; and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical. 3.182131272960118
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ; and Mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings. 2.0283865752418913
on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married. 2.1099633814305583
but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. 2.0014919790722363
from the entrance hall , of which Mr collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti chamber , to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and Mrs jenkinson were sitting. 3.1221317233939763
he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. 2.258668440608914
the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. 2.256431747411083
she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. 2.023056349384364
" you want to tell me , and i have no objection to hearing it. 3.0567573887520276
" "i do , i do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , "i love him. 2.420510377232773
you wanted me , i know , to say 'yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. 2.4240948001877474

such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , "in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned. 2.1482282316649006
miss bennet 's lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice. 3.6556591000611776

"is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ? " "not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months. 2.0649950433016544
elizabeth 's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more. 2.1540419740851733

" "oh ! thoughtless , thoughtless lydia ! " cried elizabeth when she had finished it. 2.8306777050836307

the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend. 2.0823365865387897
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything. 1.8417955915694433

" elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Mr darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat. 2.7614654517256696
that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. 1.98183106101788

" with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry. 3.47764486263
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene. 2.084466027047569
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley 's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady 's side , the acquaintance would now be renewed. 2.179628253576514

when Mr bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn. 2.256651304038627
"if i had been able , " said she , "to carry my point of going to brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her. 2.2492240996697794

my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed ! but perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , "these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. 1.9465861947509764
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with "it is your turn to say something now , Mr darcy. 2.0091354619795823

i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister. 2.2708684711352065

miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other. 2.182201033298559
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together. 2.1380576979555674
Mrs bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone Mr collins began. 2.5662686219158926
Mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth , "i am glad you are come back , lizzy. 1.918954890516897

miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men. 2.183860681707069
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. 2.378882912843407
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous. 1.9394461800328364
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham. 2.0447338551375216
"it taught me to hope , " said he , "as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. 2.333381544799749
when Mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte. 2.6931947948500254
"my dear Mr bennet , " said his lady to him one day , "have you heard that netherfield park is let at last ? " Mr bennet replied that he had not. 2.8486170153359245
to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley 's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own. 4.5900783823686115

to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her. 2.329822671980948
but no , " recollecting herself , - "that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : i should not have been allowed to invite them. 2.069586635747773

"i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. 1.7393306222201421

it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance. 1.9803515894142418
"eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds. 2.446595316466721
"you doubt me , " cried jane , slightly colouring ; "indeed you have no reason. 3.130521492325915
elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother 's thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away. 1.9512591677188125
Mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father 's active superintendance , and when immediately before my father 's death , Mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself. 2.276611436553449
" Mr wickham 's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family. 2.5230129307658937
if i have wounded your sister 's feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them. 2.40623583282171
but Mrs bennet , was not so well pleased with it. 3.9363284000286596
"it has been a very agreeable day , " said miss bennet to elizabeth. 2.7051568653942235
oh ! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! " "oh ! my dear , " continued Mrs bennet , "i am quite delighted with him. 3.1500740976080337

he addressed himself directly to miss bennet , with a polite congratulation ; Mr hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was "very glad ; " but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley 's salutation. 1.9764339379804245

bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence. 2.293634140808278
mary and kitty , thank heaven ! are quite well. 2.6725304037343838
she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times. 2.0237661528129514
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. 2.0033712866599798
she had always felt that charlotte 's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. 2.979778902530602
" "except , " thought elizabeth , "when she goes to ramsgate. 2.6111856147552674
" "the country , " said darcy , "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study. 2.21306973509685
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on. 2.6368713578089227
kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. 2.143280295232079
they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs gardiner thought of him , and Mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece 's beginning the subject. 2.6562943966253028
she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter 's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place. 2.0634742696861723

she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations. 2.417643051156677
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them. 2.338001080660063

sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. 2.4471148787887724

when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view. 1.9307434232763587
" a long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and Mrs bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. 1.939824922017383

the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings. 2.1933599901977416
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him. 2.2115064610029513
" "and what arts did he use to separate them ? " "he did not talk to me of his own arts , " said fitzwilliam smiling. 2.583437477074077

had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. 2.558102685579316
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible. 2.0772685730506324

elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley 's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself. 2.015228137195058
when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. 2.1525039028443826

allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety. 2.0997349103467253
the sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage. 2.9555376942767535

as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and Mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them. 1.8721706869322843
as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen ; but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister. 2.0623060487615676

she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected "for your housekeeper , " she added , "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow ; and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country. 2.092205298841998

your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month. 2.0242418907532476

elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough. 1.8899531338365836
Mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton. 2.139551148468415
how i long to see her ! and to see dear wickham too ! but the clothes , the wedding clothes ! i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly. 1.844753092723705
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " "if we are ever able to learn what wickham 's debts have been , " said elizabeth , "and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own. 1.9163485401790696
the supposition did not pain her. 2.3803422282541122
not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself ; for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them. 2.4633056917099867
his words seemed to imply it. 2.887661968409865

on the gentlemen 's appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance. 1.8558729371973468
Mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required. 2.0346405513928714
she is quite a little creature. 3.0789298463851558
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and i am sure if i had been you , i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it. 2.3973134705785273
she shall hear my opinion. 3.0300867008263435
in such an exigence my uncle 's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his goodness. 2.2200259370740234
he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn. 1.99079137943186
she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. 2.1507920779018623
is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? a glass of wine ; shall i get you one ? you are very ill. 2.094587726785926
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery. 2.2459025025792108
i told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word. 2.740229905909162
elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled. 1.8643275535149748

how much you must have gone through ! " her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their conversation , which had been passing while Mr and Mrs gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party. 2.429622804208289
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence. 1.9310148059632994
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish. 2.6052355763758652
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , "are you pleased with kent ? " a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk. 2.176533814762351
" Mr gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from colonel forster ; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. 1.8992016018043953

they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , Mr and Mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind. 2.435946824513378

we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode. 2.312503965781673
" miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject. 2.3026230503757077
"they will join me early to morrow , " he continued , "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Mr bingley and his sisters. 2.0827567838189207
his pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure. 1.9210427647587984
i hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it i will carry my point. 1.9595263218328702
"and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but i am an idle fellow , and though i have not many , i have more than i ever look into. 2.1708733812791654
" "perhaps , " said darcy , "i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers. 2.2101799941678655
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. 2.2958056013033072
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun. 3.657249456476476
well , much good may it do them ! and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead. 1.8732457202171204
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay. 2.4601316258436774
Mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street. 2.07511798044163
"i am all astonishment. 2.7346517614673655
she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , "now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let Mr collins and me have a little conversation together. 2.40631221193093
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter. 2.3266394055354382
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this. 2.044031673551641

he was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in derbyshire. 2.3311355532167233
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. 2.4965383502966145
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy 's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. 2.2437187762591915
Mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed. 2.534213949802733

she talked to elizabeth again and again ; coaxed and threatened her by turns. 2.95785198187206
i think i have heard you say that you know them. 3.104391901796773
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used. 2.139098868886985
" "speak to lizzy about it yourself. 2.692404082738405
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement. 2.7777817249101653
" "as i did the other day , " said elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; "very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that. 2.412173522662891
Mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began. 2.112081179241387
Mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. 2.2999389092733797
let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay. 2.704625386717617
jane was beyond competition her favourite child. 2.733506638189167
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes. 2.1543027015200815
i knew that Mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman. 3.1495778292664256
" "your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said darcy , "has too much truth. 2.5483693145198
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends. 2.238250873422174
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her. 1.7897414499781372
as no objection was made to the young people 's engagement with their aunt , and all Mr collins 's scruples of leaving Mr and Mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that Mr wickham had accepted their uncle 's invitation , and was then in the house. 2.277285419688848
she could think only of her letter. 2.5447473948328465
Mr bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other. 2.523446476826199
could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ? Mr darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! it is admirable ! " elizabeth tried to join in her father 's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile. 2.1194082484052097
" "and what is your success ? " she shook her head. 2.2678288753280404
" in meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise. 2.4163762482791333
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home. 2.4361509380634545
he was angry. 3.1082172751458126
" he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said. 2.196446407128452
as a child i was taught what was right , but i was not taught to correct my temper. 2.8495516786384343
Mr collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library , ) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels. 2.711272867033837
an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure. 2.9097733514407063
" upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock. 2.046087701227986
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. 1.6877395145300003
"he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again. 2.1710387861781335
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia 's leaving home. 2.2190204623377805
" "yes , sir ; but i do not know when that will be. 3.0685356766127074
"read it aloud , " said their father , "for i hardly know myself what it is about. 2.6489911690307424
my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made. 2.151452887793382
"my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table. 2.4006312100575773
hope was over , entirely over ; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort. 2.3082184650093303
" jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern. 2.1097867216694075
there was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies. 2.050861793391672
as yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness. 2.817961460581898
i remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well wisher and friend , william collins. 2.486268200119227
the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. 1.7494046353994692
" he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself. 2.3574078947710277
" elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match. 2.1628769931758667
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. 2.859827965171375
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was Mrs hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. 2.046860425481988
i cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family. 2.021635639811187
" she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted. 2.4144442666983243
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained. 1.9926299916894148
"and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " "i hope not. 2.798164205042153
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. 2.321482659765243
wickham passed all his youth there , you know. 2.675952956817047
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here. 2.5324051138843107
the family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them. 2.6493837079998723
that is all settled. 3.2062615811400987
i did not wink at you. 3.0981698662948616
were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express. 2.48253191906976
" darcy smiled and said , "you are perfectly right. 2.519611719418433
Mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public. 2.2731578796466714
she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. 2.8880488410682705
" "my dear jane ! " exclaimed elizabeth , "you are too good. 2.270338685661795
"you begin to comprehend me , do you ? " cried he , turning towards her. 2.3354607530753513
" "it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire. 2.419509420335509
" " you go to brighton ! i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds ! no , kitty , i have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it. 2.3226917670288776
" she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her. 2.0273364749897635
and poor Mr darcy ! dear lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered. 2.3548411962045113
"he is as fine a fellow , " said Mr bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , "as ever i saw. 2.6552689331524904
" "not that i shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; "and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out. 2.4919029451950707
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets ; and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure. 2.034661393017896
"he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? if he fears me , why come hither ? if he no longer cares for me , why silent ? teazing , teazing , man ! i will think no more about him. 1.8690329379818746
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. 2.966289960404944
" this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least. 2.118334932542707
to Mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough. 2.4115379320043737
she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there. 2.33962340017982
it was unpardonable. 2.9675790749883544
"with my mother up stairs. 2.541233054965497
no one but Mrs bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home. 2.1802384814999614
she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent. 2.812705313381579
" "it is not Mr bingley , " said her husband ; "it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life. 2.504020717912156
the business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news. 2.0442604481960065
Number or Number. 2.6844452226297646
he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her. 2.043854937266511
pride & prejudice. 3.2318734860356315
a most delightful place ! excellent parsonage house ! it would have suited me in every respect. 2.1354436766835048
Mr darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding. 2.2218288060840687
why does she not come in ? " "oh ! charlotte says , she hardly ever does. 2.1285748801528945
she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour. 2.148304150092192
lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , "but if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer. 2.157595797331737
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present. 2.5064224324788755
" he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped. 3.1376821551627945
family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this. 2.465132839792686
had she found jane in any apparent danger , Mrs bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield. 2.022272327304037
" "she will drop the acquaintance entirely. 2.497343201735953
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage. 2.235721927488667
while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there for ever. 2.11634068087631
professor michael s. 3.4364634129480396
but perhaps Mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle. 1.995329685469409

"how near it may be to mine , i cannot pretend to say. 2.3517750891251445
he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday. 2.5044628977283137
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , i dare say. 2.40189948861341
the more i see of the world , the more am i dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense. 2.1875982723833
"well , well , and so Mr bingley is coming down , sister , " (for Mrs philips first brought her the news. 2.1212726914432363
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr wickham , and rejoiced in it. 2.9350165074160484
Mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , - "this walk is not wide enough for our party. 1.8860986167333853
into one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance. 2.1240323902088396
" "oh , well ! it is just as he chooses. 2.529116204401187
" "but you see that jane , " said her aunt , "does not think so ill of wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt. 2.502589206701314
with a book he was regardless of time ; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. 2.2032323502993396
Mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them. 2.231285196807292
you wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if i speak ill of any body. 2.102991329907406
but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me. 2.6772970122009605
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room , i shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me. 2.2213097733173335
"she is a great deal too ill to be moved. 2.660294361486471
"i am by no means of opinion , i assure you , " said he , "that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her. 2.0782069868144624
" chapter xviii. 2.6483899024652056
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son inlaw , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion. 2.000318148252936
he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business. 2.398791749157821
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other. 2.6013599786081416

but don 't imagine it was from any silly cause. 1.975793880159128
it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world. 1.8829805853426131
you are lucky in having such a master. 2.278465348260476
" "no , " replied jane , "i have not forgotten him ; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you. 2.992875724050281
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley. 2.086521320733946
" "and have you answered the letter ? " said elizabeth. 2.7506948322862743
" elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment. 2.6110332063360935
my dear , dear lydia ! how merry we shall be together when we meet ! " her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr gardiner 's behaviour laid them all under. 2.124592694968328
" "a great deal of good management , depend upon it. 2.460017960943883
he was her dear wickham on every occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him. 2.802273889393229
"but depend upon it , Mr collins , " she added , "that lizzy shall be brought to reason. 2.5825438393136135
" and gravely glancing at Mr darcy , "there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'keep your breath to cool your porridge , ' and i shall keep mine to swell my song. 2.032441802897325

creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works , so the foundation (and you ! ) can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties. 1.6082312312900782
" "i never thought Mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do. 2.123409326895217
"they are going to be encamped near brighton ; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all. 2.4171834710536593
till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happiness. 2.2321156816210763
Mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old. 2.2676632156653884
" "her daughter , miss de bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates. 2.941062713406505
"then , " observed elizabeth , "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman. 2.061711776975728
her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. 2.142163132367713
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas. 3.0138945539614483
" "undoubtedly , " replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , "there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. 3.0758845658719727

at length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house. 2.460792672993916
he was well , but so much engaged with Mr darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him. 2.7832580036997987
young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life. 2.0389291491864285
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , "how long did you say that he was at rosings ? " "nearly three weeks. 2.4376345853331065
such doings discomposed Mr bennet exceedingly. 2.551246672095632
what are men to rocks and mountains ? oh ! what hours of transport we shall spend ! and when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing. 13.835479512457585
Mr collins 's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete. 2.349738516500573
"i see your design , bingley , " said his friend. 2.8131223337899174
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did january and february pass away. 1.8469022197588554
she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself. 2.5220196929255074
but to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult. 2.371268252446555
never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings. 1.7590364201670026
i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town. 2.231354221945609
the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. 2.977073158870348
elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham 's name. 2.618565315590503
" "thank you but i always mend my own. 2.380254522649963
after a short pause , her companion added , "you are too generous to trifle with me. 2.1125524954976536
"your examination of Mr darcy is over , i presume , " said miss bingley ; - "and pray what is the result ? " "i am perfectly convinced by it that Mr darcy has no defect. 2.7287378222397995
a fortnight 's acquaintance is certainly very little. 2.2348803613393238
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous. 2.6315040354147605
" Mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer. 2.4363052395849984
" "could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia 's note to his wife ? " "he brought it with him for us to see. 2.0962680043712463
but she is nothing to me now. 2.601385264567601
but at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey. 2.626732830252878
jane 's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart. 2.3081421721009154
very nonsensical to come at all ! why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? her hair so untidy , so blowsy ! " "yes , and her petticoat ; i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , i am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office. 3.033904049208501
i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together. 2.43811529549783
lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome. 1.797146622008931
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr wickham 's charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice. 2.070284016763332
she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. 2.0624490874135044
all this was acknowledged to Mrs gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on : - "i am now convinced , my dear aunt , that i have never been much in love ; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil. 2.838180487788952
i suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers. 2.80661604889331
e. 2.5002575954001145
i send no compliments to your mother. 2.4938587594062245
at such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented. 2.367413869766824
but i suppose you had no opportunity. 3.5841602225508624
" "miss bennet i am shocked and astonished. 2.059343753309379
her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted. 3.9628634822704862
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it. 1.8633041576747504
Mr and Mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant 's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy. 1.8356146559845525
Mrs bennet was quite disconcerted. 2.9473363423549173
"i have an excessive regard for jane bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled. 2.597920616809807
" "oh ! shocking ! " cried miss bingley. 2.5594575926405723
" "i can easily believe it. 2.427227882626325
colonel forster will , i dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head. 2.281932489250952
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters. 1.8344682791399476

more thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed. 2.3881956641515822
she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down. 2.6737359048996305
" here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of. 3.046757751750792
" "do you really think so ? " cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment. 2.7033434923137105
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved. 2.348153135824091

" " my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , eliza , " said charlotte. 2.5738193370279836
oh ! how acutely did she now feel it. 2.4949611436149564
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. 2.5099212814872454
she is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. 2.189710635171341
he was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty. 2.3654415125442347
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed. 2.850434131538977
the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention. 2.314341422801168
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement. 2.5193153859458945

he came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed. 2.893355259230486
from their infancy , they have been intended for each other. 3.2879706554947004
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner. 2.3791544971469802
charlotte had seen them from her husband 's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , "i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility. 2.008451836364209
pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned. 2.229641332861811
" her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it. 2.459596679954425
"i am trying to make it out. 2.543329712734849
" "it is evident by this , " added jane , "that he comes back no more this winter. 2.1412852776407
" "all ! what , all five out at once ? very odd ! and you only the second. 1.7236350703164793
" "i shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own. 2.106981414848625
" "and so was i. 2.438082428458496
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there. 2.3022857204978386
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. 2.5075626782944838
" "certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. 2.667662532520435
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day. 1.8787506149427053
" "are you quite sure , ma 'am ? is not there a little mistake ? " said jane. 2.7245574079820374
in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. 2.229986741830382
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved. 2.5185089724354737
when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. 2.191331297148367
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem. 2.9214198760433394
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness. 2.633345086088165
i. 3.623350216275888
thank god ! i have not that pain. 2.694245130670205
in comparing her recollection of pemberley , with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself. 2.324660912170666
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity. 2.644400386160244
" elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself. 2.1445824932285524
he is so excessively handsome ! and his sisters are charming women. 2.1766493332722874
Mr hurst and Mr bingley were at piquet , and Mrs hurst was observing their game. 2.7819837208816334
" "and so ended his affection , " said elizabeth impatiently. 2.595784489142655
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry. 2.1638803300971787
Mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. 1.7804769609623607
he has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers. 2.0987811397909857
i thought i should have died. 3.348621254234949
" "you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. 2.582384407863464
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. 1.9844242371782745
" "and i certainly never shall give it. 2.1262307855671625
" you began the evening well , charlotte , " said Mrs bennet with civil self command to miss lucas. 2.1951409660822376
" "oh , no ! " said elizabeth. 3.1533312721728226
" "well , then supposing them to be in london. 2.5509028136945595
you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people. 2.6493149379063667
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer. 2.0638967940928823
this cannot be ! engaged to Mr darcy ! no , no , you shall not deceive me. 2.5218725587257373
he replied , and was again silent. 3.6624760937210494
" a short pause followed this speech , and Mrs hurst began again. 3.032077482260712
Number. 2.2885629017403297
" she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley. 2.4953907994435984
" elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. 2.2610738407747464
those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable. 2.1451045208069965
"fitzwilliam darcy. 3.42505396845299
but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. 2.5141941794095803
Mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room. 2.3330432842503677
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband. 3.735201118326886
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing. 1.9435296464468659
other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose fordyce 's sermons. 2.0221722422946384
e. 2.5002575954001145
one does not know what to think. 3.0332875414832006
her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object. 2.3012700634743233
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother 's being an inmate of Mr darcy 's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture. 2.572924637291284
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night. 2.221277445752996
it is a nice long walk , and Mr darcy has never seen the view. 2.4387163327690393
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. 2.6946396673117294
" "is this a hint to me , lizzy , " said her father , "to send for the horses ? " "no , indeed. 2.9403803701181945
after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men. 2.5900729511531186
elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down stairs from her mother 's apartment , immediately met her. 2.0045713788133814
to Mr bennet 's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. 12.681199871229506
she will be taken good care of. 2.501064687278362
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation. 2.1373702622672814
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse. 2.44902376128723
" "do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " "it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it. 2.196711820764163
" "and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " "my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle 's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour. 2.169681478464871
" "already arisen ! " repeated Mr bennet. 2.3418898670628123
" "can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? " "yes. 1.9608162197896357
chapter i. 2.8567437163073115
at night she opened her heart to jane. 2.1883625446659303
" "if you were aware , " said elizabeth , "of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia 's unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair. 2.5065372789023628
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia 's flight , on her own folly alone. 1.9754900729252511
a. 4.1421680630979045
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. 1.9218932221986287
" Mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it. 2.49962222561048
" "what think you of books ? " said he , smiling. 2.394271114632283
" "neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied elizabeth , "have any possible claim on me , in the present instance. 2.171019749839305
" elizabeth was distressed. 2.746923840653052
" her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth. 1.929824940502553
" "my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now. 3.591549150902612
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship 's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give. 2.0595465730973217
a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme. 2.348043620483859
she could think of nothing else , and yet whether bingley 's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of jane 's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister 's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded. 1.946628189058308
as soon as i get to town , i shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to gracechurch street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done. 3.11042449049901
" "perhaps that is not possible for any one. 2.843443039425152
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them. 1.9563305334268066
elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes. 2.4203034199670403
it was very little less. 3.044274269467015
jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. 2.080398177188057
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of Mr collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings. 3.120958296053684
your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us. 2.4448458969126827
" "my dearest sister , now be be serious. 2.1972032245849067
but now suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err. 1.8694489234771448
nobody can tell what i suffer ! but it is always so. 3.0913859619271573
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented. 3.558839531452299

but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. 2.0850207443443995
" the boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit. 2.278466435427728
- "oh ! Mr collins ! " - "my dear madam , " replied he , "let us be for ever silent on this point. 2.2100085383269508
i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older. 2.139530992680143
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. 1.8258460178185325
"is it not clear enough ? does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother 's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means (most kindly ! ) to put me on my guard ? can there be any other opinion on the subject ? " "yes , there can ; for mine is totally different. 2.6420833945510833
oh ! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. 1.98566897075018
could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected. 3.563029166576313
you will have a charming mother inlaw , indeed , and of course she will be always at pemberley with you. 2.602963079992236
they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. 1.944565614332805
wretched , wretched , mistake ! " darcy made no answer. 2.0823088690293567
- "i wish i could call her amiable. 2.8789221523348556
you see on what a footing we are. 2.614269251036695
" "but , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood. 2.1566250193341134
" "she is a great fool for going away , if she liked him. 2.8163448517070098
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen. 2.9968032530899795
" darcy mentioned his letter. 2.5306911457565207
the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away. 2.7735379077084445
"tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley 's. 2.3749316258267887
" "neglect ! i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. 2.206517699989893
lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr darcy. 2.50652115015054

elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship 's indignation would have been. 3.1881840175371847
after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Mr collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer. 2.076343936464698
seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman 's concurrence. 2.2507104221496337
elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between Mr wickham and herself. 2.384516881523702

" "are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? " "both , " replied elizabeth archly ; "for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. 2.772908754198836
" "colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia 's side , but nothing to give him any alarm. 1.8864166478402569
i beg you will not go. 3.154751888597815
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner. 1.9642129135620636
" "it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first. 2.4188315260308624

" "it may do very well for the others , " replied Mr bingley ; "but i am sure it will be too much for kitty. 2.6876038708555625
" Mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt 's ill breeding , and made no answer. 2.1524895947840865
sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion. 2.2871605799653576
Mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. 2.5328179371676502
" "how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it ! but i wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself. 2.352664209384283

in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other. 2.9215775040458385
in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which jane was equally eager to satisfy. 2.0004001012005
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. 1.8011456311678626
" "oh ! " said lydia stoutly , "i am not afraid ; for though i am the youngest , i 'm the tallest. 2.6557075011313573
it was only said , 'lately , george wickham , esq. 2.9006232806599015
Mr bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him. 2.91029931033269
clement 's , because wickham 's lodgings were in that parish. 2.2011697247233237
" she then sat still five minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , "come here , my love , i want to speak to you , " took her out of the room. 2.168366609449102
" "aye , so it is , " cried her mother , "and Mrs long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself. 3.0760784679382276
"are you not diverted ? " "oh ! yes. 2.719345962853682
"my dear madam , " he replied , "this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible. 2.4286658292525107
poor dear child ! and now here 's Mr bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? the collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what we shall do. 2.731023896886794
it is highly improper. 2.743129780033714
"i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places. 1.9593756681022447
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him ! he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! not handsome enough to dance with ! i wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs. 2.1106244735832087
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion. 2.215285850977397
" he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away. 1.5899891532227144
his former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. 2.7086271256202226
"a place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected. 2.0823669341757207
it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that jane 's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before. 2.6191273801112676
"my father and maria are to come to me in march , " added charlotte , "and i hope you will consent to be of the party. 2.646564594604763
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday. 2.3319664600160888
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security. 2.082772664178477
are you much acquainted with Mr darcy ? " "as much as i ever wish to be , " cried elizabeth warmly , - "i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable. 2.427028210740561
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. 2.121932248387839
i know it cannot be long. 3.104542775952374
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. 2.5715399636439336
do your sisters play and sing ? " "one of them does. 2.659498424908488
" "very true , my dear , that is exactly what i say. 2.62203332783722
" * * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday ; and Mrs bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour 's visit , had revived. 2.2107117839599573
he readily agreed to it. 2.7223809249355284
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her. 2.9168343330972863
such i was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth ! what do i not owe you ! you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous. 1.6795192420605058
" "i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. 1.9440159470478573
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance. 3.1715635874079537
" * * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased Mrs bennet 's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject. 2.2687410550881664
f. 2.7701078899210225
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the turning past , he was immediately before them. 1.8274280497523323
but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival of jane. 2.8647859359953505
do not let us quarrel about the past. 2.371404734368558
had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt , to my own family ! had his character been known , this could not have happened. 2.1348737094824495
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose. 2.0018307520377348
in short , i will do my best. 2.9232449916935472
she read over her aunt 's commendation of him again and again. 2.2494849923219964
the world has been deceived in that respect ; and i am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune. 2.083491906605664
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above. 2.430480166860137
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule. 1.920075893545088
the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch. 2.6317628806941857
"this fine account of him , " whispered her aunt , as they walked , "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend. 3.297849066269027
at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , "how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book ! when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library. 2.053851057178571
" "yes , indeed , " cried Mrs bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. 2.615780354446318
"it may perhaps be pleasant , " replied charlotte , "to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. 3.218761556975451
Mr collins on his return highly gratified Mrs bennet by admiring Mrs philips 's manners and politeness. 2.419190512482109
in revolving lady catherine 's expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. 2.7315572798323835
"how can you be smiling so , lizzy ? " their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago. 1.8861097360134254
for your sake , " turning to charlotte , "i am glad of it ; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. 2.08727271857171
the old lady is Mrs jenkinson , who lives with them. 2.084917645598521

as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. 1.9709564891525597
the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me. 2.2486138371570252
" the loss of her daughter made Mrs bennet very dull for several days. 2.0602461479855636
" they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and Mr gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist Mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia. 2.0927232060183334
oh ! had i known what i ought , what i dared , to do ! but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much. 1.979036609059426
" "i know you do ; and it is that which makes the wonder. 2.3104102646802773
two days after Mr bennet 's return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , "i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask. 2.997431190804152
they had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about. 2.139968799864488
by the author of "sense and sensibility. 2.01682775850703
but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it. 2.883834122406863
this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father 's estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part. 2.7877034535855545
"i am sure , " she added , "if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with. 2.7623633903971934
he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , "that will do extremely well , child. 1.9145300075086191

" "in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure , " said bingley ; "and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well. 2.950623182188724
" "do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? " "sometimes. 2.120375576429923
when first Mr bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless ; for , of course , they were to have a son. 2.9017112469992683
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people 's happiness were in his guardianship ! how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! how much of good or evil must be done by him ! every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression. 2.4743880091619483

that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as Mr bingley , was incomprehensible. 2.384783281092179
they were in - street. 2.5956484496169963

" "but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? " "it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , "that a sister 's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. 2.0738477200529806
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. 2.870592110212699
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. 2.226099683794182
" "but you forget , mama , " said elizabeth , "that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs long has promised to introduce him. 2.6913121907960984
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least. 1.93048759628512
" "you are quite right. 2.622467673420188
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. 2.228862725061539
let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest. 2.2427084065347223
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers. 1.889251209942591
it is impossible that he should still love me. 2.54164272576469
it would be dreadful ! she blushed at the very idea ; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk. 2.065159792979296
the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely. 3.5391405326132306
but i think Mr darcy improves on acquaintance. 2.692282671802061
" "it is amazing to me , " said bingley , "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are. 2.510490526306943
" how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! her aunt now called her to look at a picture. 1.637851170420084
they may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride. 1.699334503806965
" elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances. 1.826311547812525
she comes to us to day. 2.96756443463669
"i want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister 's , "what you have learnt about Mr wickham. 2.49829801368621
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage. 3.4221402874876032
i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection. 2.7759235972139025
when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish. 2.143746793260292
let me hear from you very soon. 2.559931726588863
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted. 2.03753278837036
" the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr bennet 's visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner. 2.965088236809024
it was an animating subject , and Mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. 2.101863089178387
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr darcy 's looks and behaviour. 3.4206715819941027
i knew how it would be. 3.14569861514947
" "true , " said Mr bennet , "but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it. 2.3736508223462853
there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again. 2.2350350522933957
a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing. 4.133466809471369
jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare. 2.7278655701853767
and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it. 2.6351209792970764
Mr darcy is engaged to my daughter. 3.4410440332178918
when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to Mr bingley. 1.86130102827535
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. 2.789435157575012
Mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary. 2.4094508326094752
"how strange this is ! and for this we are to be thankful. 2.056773000486892
every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh. 2.4247773170566913
i shall go distracted. 2.8306872928726876
to be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love. 2.295313911881445
"there is nothing the matter with me. 2.250604348388103
"books oh ! no. 2.8266251888094263
with your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! affectation of candour is common enough ; one meets it every where. 2.3778337117523476
" "dining out , " said Mrs bennet , "that is very unlucky. 3.7707458601471906
" "ah ! you do not know what i suffer. 3.0088501759883286
Mrs gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her. 2.8827029643407815
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of lady catherine 's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough. 2.5674064388574056
but i have always observed , that they who are good natured when children , are good natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous hearted , boy in the world. 2.0431773561769075
i knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them. 2.08402729592181
"your friend performs delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group ; - "and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Mr darcy. 2.1697169811788473
"is miss darcy much grown since the spring ? " said miss bingley ; "will she be as tall as i am ? " "i think she will. 2.2841498969644647
without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment. 2.477309953212299
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr philips 's. 2.5022236625761

jane was not happy. 2.8157426610444576
she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard. 1.9805090242188306
she opened the door , and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , "oh , my dear eliza ! pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! i will not tell you what it is. 2.994750432273406
" "i am not going to run away , papa , " said kitty , fretfully ; "if i should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia. 2.2371544902349223
we were always good friends ; and now we are better. 2.286442191638667
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia. 2.1466499125419087
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter. 1.9941216547537193
what a delightful library you have at pemberley , Mr darcy ! " "it ought to be good , " he replied , "it has been the work of many generations. 2.4956799441250452
but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding. 2.337491797650814
" elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse woman , walking was her only alternative. 2.3783935473660094
this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married. 3.3004250868345886
"you may well warn me against such an evil. 2.4510465922979705
" elizabeth shook her head over this letter. 2.310394677247735
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. 2.144996579649642
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance. 2.0647230868495807
Mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast. 2.5507958788158103

it is evident that you belong to the first circles. 2.951884662530632
" elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet. 1.7448357317871688
recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , "sir william 's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of. 2.687126419502033
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting Mr collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go. 2.458566794674182

i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him. 2.9473125627612045
"i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter ! " "la ! my dear , " said maria quite shocked at the mistake , "it is not lady catherine. 2.7760288480885364
"but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , " replied her uncle. 2.842702008357468

before any answer could arrive from Mr collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth , from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge. 2.322718984015883
" "they have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he ; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. 1.8223218915859278

miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before. 2.328003356484079
the evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of jane and elizabeth. 24.944275972170217
they were natural and just. 2.558644573750086
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side. 2.0569800255461503
" "i hope not so. 2.62960030075447
i wonder when you would have spoken , if i had not asked you ! my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect. 1.9449922537990267
i have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude. 2.551659689720781
if i had ever learnt , i should have been a great proficient. 3.401346032401216
" "oh ! my dear brother , " replied Mrs bennet , "that is exactly what i could most wish for. 2.5596719661851144
lord ! how i should like to be married before any of you ; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls. 2.5855760760270465
from the farther disadvantage of lydia 's society she was of course carefully kept , and though Mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going. 1.9744662417647518
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him. 2.190613062455042

" she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. 2.03262214979334
in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great. 2.151352009511299

there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. 2.7616144427835776
" Mr wickham 's attention was caught ; and after observing Mr collins for a few moments , he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh. 2.037391275730603
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it. 2.2331790126895936
i hope we may often meet again. 2.402974366166106
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day. 2.0371700841071774

they are not married , nor can i find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side , i hope it will not be long before they are. 2.773365433207188
bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time. 2.8019128915586653
" "how i long to see her again ! i never met with anybody who delighted me so much. 2.055492450558499
lady catherine 's great attentions to Mrs collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent. 2.1030114723668865
" the tumult of elizabeth 's mind was allayed by this conversation. 2.6713876918309993
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter. 1.7091414879955986
"he is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? " elizabeth looked archly , and turned away. 2.8675199365025468
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way. 2.782795127865116
"i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle. 2.2815021594047447
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far. 2.1597495189984084

he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others. 2.3726933803718406
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love. 2.326886198564338
sir william had been delighted with him. 2.2559383524134344
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. 2.561979396103129

the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter , and concluded with her brother 's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country. 1.869014716449899
but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister 's absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized. 1.8255406233574214
Mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state. 2.7292844677226116
i am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him. 2.1458305975482665
i always said it must be so , at last. 2.577716505936736
"how can you be so silly , " cried her mother , "as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! you will not be fit to be seen when you get there. 2.513608376333842
their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! let me never see either one or the other again ! " yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover. 1.7277773298721342
" "oh ! hang kitty ! what has she to do with it ? come be quick , be quick ! where is your sash my dear ? " but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters. 1.8307309009817483
"he must be an oddity , i think , " said she. 3.4510981773755414
that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! oh , lydia ! " "i comfort myself with thinking , " replied jane , "that he certainly would not marry lydia , if he had not a real regard for her. 2.0671080419810983
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; i can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side. 2.070339759458719

" "if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there. 1.9585162432760943
is this to be endured ! but it must not , shall not be. 2.4222529788223555
her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine 's curiosity. 2.02406241616479
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where Mr darcy then was. 2.0540857448836576
he owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable. 2.1608815210950456
" "you have said quite enough , madam. 2.5262705390183093
she must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains. 1.933353960658606
she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents. 2.045512545828845
intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done. 2.793751626244893
miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed. 2.0843300482380545
"there were some very strong objections against the lady , " were colonel fitzwilliam 's words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london. 1.6636971716639553
my father was not only fond of this young man 's society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it. 1.9242128552000872
" Mr and Mrs gardiner smiled. 2.94581007438978
the gentlemen did approach ; and when Mr wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. 2.247463326473383
that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him. 2.5229076844921807
the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock ; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome. 2.4354494618267677
"shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? " "i can answer your question , " said fitzwilliam , "without applying to him. 2.7456097393632493
i will try again. 2.8029248158885673
it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen 's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. 2.226053571937003

here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. 2.3903769908059624
they were of course all intending to be surprised ; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation ; and on the part of Mrs bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt. 2.2048660403610785
" "after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. 1.851655517909279
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house. 3.798527030929948
Mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton. 1.8796013095418935
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister 's infamous elopement. 2.116674766468849
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least. 2.1590489298163824
" before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer. 1.9437166382555247
"i know not , miss elizabeth , " said he , "whether Mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it. 2.290866811675304
she was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper. 3.1950700449268714
" "my mother would have had no objection , but my father hates london. 2.315920693973867
but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country. 1.8624405637283945
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur. 2.641121544842069
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth 's sake , he assisted him farther in his profession. 1.9501457488161373
" "to be sure , lizzy , " said her aunt , "he is not so handsome as wickham ; or rather he has not wickham 's countenance , for his features are perfectly good. 2.1578327801782446
" chapter iv. 2.894021284392784
" "i am not now to learn , " replied Mr collins , with a formal wave of the hand , "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time. 2.00951098192588
" "upon my word ! well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know. 1.7328716827033461
