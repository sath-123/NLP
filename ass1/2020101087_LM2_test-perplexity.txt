" Mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. 2.087116135940079
" when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend 's connections , than from their want of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining Mr bingley for his sister. 2.479267093683192

bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them. 2.677944928366047
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate. 2.4604619020425473
" "if you mean darcy , " cried her brother , "he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards. 2.2095770485284865
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. 2.001903049337511
it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane 's attractions. 2.2680680007338467

the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ; and Mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings. 2.0283865752418913
on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married. 2.1099633814305583
but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. 2.0014919790722363
from the entrance hall , of which Mr collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti chamber , to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and Mrs jenkinson were sitting. 3.1221317233939763
he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. 2.258668440608914
the good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. 2.256431747411083
she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. 2.023056349384364

you wanted me , i know , to say 'yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. 2.4240948001877474
Mr bennet treated the matter differently. 2.390345517951462
" "no , " said her father , "wickham 's a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. 2.531183220683344
she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs collins 's joints of meat were too large for her family. 2.5840576582697787

miss bennet 's lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority ; and for the first evening she was his settled choice. 3.6556591000611776

"is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ? " "not so much as i could wish , sir ; but i dare say he may spend half his time here ; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months. 2.0649950433016544
elizabeth 's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more. 2.1540419740851733

" "oh ! thoughtless , thoughtless lydia ! " cried elizabeth when she had finished it. 2.8306777050836307

the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend. 2.0823365865387897

" elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Mr darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat. 2.7614654517256696

they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene. 2.084466027047569
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley 's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady 's side , the acquaintance would now be renewed. 2.179628253576514

when Mr bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn. 2.256651304038627
"if i had been able , " said she , "to carry my point of going to brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened ; but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her. 2.2492240996697794

Mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth , "i am glad you are come back , lizzy. 1.918954890516897

miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men. 2.183860681707069
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. 2.378882912843407
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous. 1.9394461800328364
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham. 2.0447338551375216

"i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. 1.7393306222201421
they are gone off together from brighton. 2.238006765694847

it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance. 1.9803515894142418
"eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds. 2.446595316466721
"you doubt me , " cried jane , slightly colouring ; "indeed you have no reason. 3.130521492325915
elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother 's thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away. 1.9512591677188125
Mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father 's active superintendance , and when immediately before my father 's death , Mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself. 2.276611436553449
" Mr wickham 's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family. 2.5230129307658937
if i have wounded your sister 's feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them. 2.40623583282171
but Mrs bennet , was not so well pleased with it. 3.9363284000286596
"it has been a very agreeable day , " said miss bennet to elizabeth. 2.7051568653942235
oh ! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! " "oh ! my dear , " continued Mrs bennet , "i am quite delighted with him. 3.1500740976080337

i have not forgot , you see ; and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement. 2.458036455263809

she danced four dances with him at meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times. 2.0237661528129514
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. 2.0033712866599798
she had always felt that charlotte 's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. 2.979778902530602
" "except , " thought elizabeth , "when she goes to ramsgate. 2.6111856147552674
" "the country , " said darcy , "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study. 2.21306973509685
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on. 2.6368713578089227
kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. 2.143280295232079
they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs gardiner thought of him , and Mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece 's beginning the subject. 2.6562943966253028
she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter 's nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place. 2.0634742696861723
it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side. 2.1022180694303354

she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations. 2.417643051156677
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them. 2.338001080660063

" a long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and Mrs bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. 1.939824922017383

the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings. 2.1933599901977416

elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley 's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself. 2.015228137195058
when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. 2.1525039028443826

the gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , "are you pleased with kent ? " a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk. 2.176533814762351

they soon outstripped the others , and when they had reached the carriage , Mr and Mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind. 2.435946824513378

" miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject. 2.3026230503757077
"they will join me early to morrow , " he continued , "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , Mr bingley and his sisters. 2.0827567838189207
his pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure. 1.9210427647587984

well , much good may it do them ! and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead. 1.8732457202171204
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay. 2.4601316258436774
Mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday ; on tuesday , his wife received a letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street. 2.07511798044163
"i am all astonishment. 2.7346517614673655
she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , "now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let Mr collins and me have a little conversation together. 2.40631221193093
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party ; and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter. 2.3266394055354382

he was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; but it had not been so in derbyshire. 2.3311355532167233
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. 2.4965383502966145
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy 's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. 2.2437187762591915

but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used. 2.139098868886985
" "speak to lizzy about it yourself. 2.692404082738405
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement. 2.7777817249101653
" "as i did the other day , " said elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; "very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that. 2.412173522662891
Mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began. 2.112081179241387
Mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. 2.2999389092733797

miss de bourgh was pale and sickly ; her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes. 2.1543027015200815
i knew that Mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman. 3.1495778292664256
" "your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said darcy , "has too much truth. 2.5483693145198
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends. 2.238250873422174
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her. 1.7897414499781372
as no objection was made to the young people 's engagement with their aunt , and all Mr collins 's scruples of leaving Mr and Mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that Mr wickham had accepted their uncle 's invitation , and was then in the house. 2.277285419688848
she could think only of her letter. 2.5447473948328465
Mr bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other. 2.523446476826199
could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ? Mr darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! it is admirable ! " elizabeth tried to join in her father 's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile. 2.1194082484052097
" "and what is your success ? " she shook her head. 2.2678288753280404
" in meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise. 2.4163762482791333
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home. 2.4361509380634545

Mr collins readily assented , and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library , ) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels. 2.711272867033837

compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. 1.6877395145300003
"he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again. 2.1710387861781335
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia 's leaving home. 2.2190204623377805
" "yes , sir ; but i do not know when that will be. 3.0685356766127074
"read it aloud , " said their father , "for i hardly know myself what it is about. 2.6489911690307424
my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made. 2.151452887793382
"my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table. 2.4006312100575773
hope was over , entirely over ; and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort. 2.3082184650093303
" jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern. 2.1097867216694075
there was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies. 2.050861793391672
as yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness. 2.817961460581898
i remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well wisher and friend , william collins. 2.486268200119227
the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their sisters ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. 1.7494046353994692
" he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself. 2.3574078947710277
" elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match. 2.1628769931758667
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded ; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. 2.859827965171375
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was Mrs hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. 2.046860425481988
i cannot acquit him of that duty ; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family. 2.021635639811187
" she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted. 2.4144442666983243
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained. 1.9926299916894148
"and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " "i hope not. 2.798164205042153

i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here. 2.5324051138843107
the family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them. 2.6493837079998723
that is all settled. 3.2062615811400987
i did not wink at you. 3.0981698662948616

" darcy smiled and said , "you are perfectly right. 2.519611719418433
Mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public. 2.2731578796466714
she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. 2.8880488410682705
" "my dear jane ! " exclaimed elizabeth , "you are too good. 2.270338685661795
"you begin to comprehend me , do you ? " cried he , turning towards her. 2.3354607530753513

" she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her. 2.0273364749897635
and poor Mr darcy ! dear lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered. 2.3548411962045113
"he is as fine a fellow , " said Mr bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , "as ever i saw. 2.6552689331524904
" "not that i shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter ; "and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out. 2.4919029451950707
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets ; and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure. 2.034661393017896
"he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? if he fears me , why come hither ? if he no longer cares for me , why silent ? teazing , teazing , man ! i will think no more about him. 1.8690329379818746
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. 2.966289960404944
" this letter gave elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least. 2.118334932542707
to Mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough. 2.4115379320043737
she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there. 2.33962340017982

no one but Mrs bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home. 2.1802384814999614
she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent. 2.812705313381579
" "it is not Mr bingley , " said her husband ; "it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life. 2.504020717912156

Mr darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding. 2.2218288060840687
why does she not come in ? " "oh ! charlotte says , she hardly ever does. 2.1285748801528945
she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour. 2.148304150092192
lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , "but if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer. 2.157595797331737
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present. 2.5064224324788755

had she found jane in any apparent danger , Mrs bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield. 2.022272327304037
" "she will drop the acquaintance entirely. 2.497343201735953
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage. 2.235721927488667

she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr wickham , and rejoiced in it. 2.9350165074160484

Mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them. 2.231285196807292

"they are going to be encamped near brighton ; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all. 2.4171834710536593

Mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old. 2.2676632156653884
" "her daughter , miss de bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates. 2.941062713406505
"then , " observed elizabeth , "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman. 2.061711776975728
her power was sinking ; every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. 2.142163132367713
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas. 3.0138945539614483
" "undoubtedly , " replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , "there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. 3.0758845658719727

at length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house. 2.460792672993916
he was well , but so much engaged with Mr darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him. 2.7832580036997987
young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life. 2.0389291491864285
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , "how long did you say that he was at rosings ? " "nearly three weeks. 2.4376345853331065
such doings discomposed Mr bennet exceedingly. 2.551246672095632
what are men to rocks and mountains ? oh ! what hours of transport we shall spend ! and when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing. 13.835479512457585
Mr collins 's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete. 2.349738516500573
"i see your design , bingley , " said his friend. 2.8131223337899174
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did january and february pass away. 1.8469022197588554
she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself. 2.5220196929255074
but to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult. 2.371268252446555
never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings. 1.7590364201670026
i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town. 2.231354221945609
the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. 2.977073158870348
elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham 's name. 2.618565315590503
" "thank you but i always mend my own. 2.380254522649963
after a short pause , her companion added , "you are too generous to trifle with me. 2.1125524954976536
"your examination of Mr darcy is over , i presume , " said miss bingley ; - "and pray what is the result ? " "i am perfectly convinced by it that Mr darcy has no defect. 2.7287378222397995
a fortnight 's acquaintance is certainly very little. 2.2348803613393238
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous. 2.6315040354147605
" Mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer. 2.4363052395849984
" "could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia 's note to his wife ? " "he brought it with him for us to see. 2.0962680043712463
but she is nothing to me now. 2.601385264567601
but at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey. 2.626732830252878
jane 's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart. 2.3081421721009154
very nonsensical to come at all ! why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? her hair so untidy , so blowsy ! " "yes , and her petticoat ; i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , i am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office. 3.033904049208501
i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together. 2.43811529549783
lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome. 1.797146622008931
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr wickham 's charge , exceedingly shocked her ; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice. 2.070284016763332
she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence ; Mr darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. 2.0624490874135044
all this was acknowledged to Mrs gardiner ; and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on : - "i am now convinced , my dear aunt , that i have never been much in love ; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil. 2.838180487788952

" "miss bennet i am shocked and astonished. 2.059343753309379
her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted. 3.9628634822704862
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it. 1.8633041576747504
Mr and Mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant 's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy. 1.8356146559845525
Mrs bennet was quite disconcerted. 2.9473363423549173
"i have an excessive regard for jane bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled. 2.597920616809807
" "oh ! shocking ! " cried miss bingley. 2.5594575926405723
" "i can easily believe it. 2.427227882626325
colonel forster will , i dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head. 2.281932489250952

she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down. 2.6737359048996305

the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention. 2.314341422801168
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement. 2.5193153859458945

it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner. 2.3791544971469802
charlotte had seen them from her husband 's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , "i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility. 2.008451836364209

" "i shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own. 2.106981414848625

it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day. 1.8787506149427053
" "are you quite sure , ma 'am ? is not there a little mistake ? " said jane. 2.7245574079820374
in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. 2.229986741830382
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved. 2.5185089724354737
when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. 2.191331297148367
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him ; and Mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem. 2.9214198760433394

in comparing her recollection of pemberley , with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself. 2.324660912170666
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity. 2.644400386160244
" elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself. 2.1445824932285524
he is so excessively handsome ! and his sisters are charming women. 2.1766493332722874
Mr hurst and Mr bingley were at piquet , and Mrs hurst was observing their game. 2.7819837208816334
" "and so ended his affection , " said elizabeth impatiently. 2.595784489142655
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , make them marry. 2.1638803300971787
Mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. 1.7804769609623607
he has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers. 2.0987811397909857

Mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room. 2.3330432842503677
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband. 3.735201118326886
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing. 1.9435296464468659

she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother 's being an inmate of Mr darcy 's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture. 2.572924637291284
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night. 2.221277445752996
it is a nice long walk , and Mr darcy has never seen the view. 2.4387163327690393
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. 2.6946396673117294
" "is this a hint to me , lizzy , " said her father , "to send for the horses ? " "no , indeed. 2.9403803701181945
after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men. 2.5900729511531186
elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down stairs from her mother 's apartment , immediately met her. 2.0045713788133814
to Mr bennet 's acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. 12.681199871229506
she will be taken good care of. 2.501064687278362
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation. 2.1373702622672814
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse. 2.44902376128723
" "do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " "it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it. 2.196711820764163
" "and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " "my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle 's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour. 2.169681478464871

he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia 's flight , on her own folly alone. 1.9754900729252511

but when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. 1.9218932221986287

" "what think you of books ? " said he , smiling. 2.394271114632283
" "neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied elizabeth , "have any possible claim on me , in the present instance. 2.171019749839305

she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship 's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give. 2.0595465730973217
a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme. 2.348043620483859
she could think of nothing else , and yet whether bingley 's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of jane 's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister 's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded. 1.946628189058308

their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them. 1.9563305334268066
elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes. 2.4203034199670403
it was very little less. 3.044274269467015
jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. 2.080398177188057
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of Mr collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings. 3.120958296053684

" "yes , there can ; for mine is totally different. 2.6420833945510833
oh ! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. 1.98566897075018

after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , Mr collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer. 2.076343936464698
seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman 's concurrence. 2.2507104221496337

at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner. 1.9642129135620636

it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family ; and as she considered that jane 's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before. 2.6191273801112676
"my father and maria are to come to me in march , " added charlotte , "and i hope you will consent to be of the party. 2.646564594604763

he readily agreed to it. 2.7223809249355284
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her. 2.9168343330972863

" * * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased Mrs bennet 's curiosity ; and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject. 2.2687410550881664

at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , "how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book ! when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library. 2.053851057178571
" "yes , indeed , " cried Mrs bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. 2.615780354446318
"it may perhaps be pleasant , " replied charlotte , "to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. 3.218761556975451
Mr collins on his return highly gratified Mrs bennet by admiring Mrs philips 's manners and politeness. 2.419190512482109

two days after Mr bennet 's return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , "i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask. 2.997431190804152
they had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about. 2.139968799864488

he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted. 2.03753278837036
" the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr bennet 's visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner. 2.965088236809024
it was an animating subject , and Mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. 2.101863089178387
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr darcy 's looks and behaviour. 3.4206715819941027
i knew how it would be. 3.14569861514947
" "true , " said Mr bennet , "but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it. 2.3736508223462853
there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again. 2.2350350522933957

jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare. 2.7278655701853767
and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it. 2.6351209792970764
Mr darcy is engaged to my daughter. 3.4410440332178918
when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to Mr bingley. 1.86130102827535
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. 2.789435157575012
Mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary. 2.4094508326094752
"how strange this is ! and for this we are to be thankful. 2.056773000486892
every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as Mr collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh. 2.4247773170566913
i shall go distracted. 2.8306872928726876

" "ah ! you do not know what i suffer. 3.0088501759883286
Mrs gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her. 2.8827029643407815
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of lady catherine 's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough. 2.5674064388574056
but i have always observed , that they who are good natured when children , are good natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous hearted , boy in the world. 2.0431773561769075
i knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them. 2.08402729592181
"your friend performs delightfully ; " he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group ; - "and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Mr darcy. 2.1697169811788473
"is miss darcy much grown since the spring ? " said miss bingley ; "will she be as tall as i am ? " "i think she will. 2.2841498969644647
without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment. 2.477309953212299
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr philips 's. 2.5022236625761

she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard. 1.9805090242188306
she opened the door , and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , "oh , my dear eliza ! pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! i will not tell you what it is. 2.994750432273406
" "i am not going to run away , papa , " said kitty , fretfully ; "if i should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia. 2.2371544902349223
we were always good friends ; and now we are better. 2.286442191638667
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia. 2.1466499125419087
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter. 1.9941216547537193
what a delightful library you have at pemberley , Mr darcy ! " "it ought to be good , " he replied , "it has been the work of many generations. 2.4956799441250452
but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding. 2.337491797650814
" elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse woman , walking was her only alternative. 2.3783935473660094
this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married. 3.3004250868345886
"you may well warn me against such an evil. 2.4510465922979705
" elizabeth shook her head over this letter. 2.310394677247735
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. 2.144996579649642
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance. 2.0647230868495807
Mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast. 2.5507958788158103

it is evident that you belong to the first circles. 2.951884662530632
" elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet. 1.7448357317871688
recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , "sir william 's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of. 2.687126419502033
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting Mr collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go. 2.458566794674182

"i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter ! " "la ! my dear , " said maria quite shocked at the mistake , "it is not lady catherine. 2.7760288480885364

she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do ; and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side. 2.0569800255461503
" "i hope not so. 2.62960030075447

lord ! how i should like to be married before any of you ; and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls. 2.5855760760270465
from the farther disadvantage of lydia 's society she was of course carefully kept , and though Mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going. 1.9744662417647518

it was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day. 2.0371700841071774

bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time. 2.8019128915586653

a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love. 2.326886198564338

her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine 's curiosity. 2.02406241616479
