 a white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket. 3.803612423004051
)_  iii preparatory to anything else mr bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox samaritan fashion which he very badly needed. 42.7557581800998
 his (stephen’s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman’s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral. 53.32648910438278
 but how to get there was the rub. 2.5738403881613183
 for the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which stephen repeatedly yawned. 37.64992087445625
 so far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e. 20.687210869859523
ed, particularly stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found. 10.941152447198608
 accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier’s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergin’s. 70.29490723667261
 but as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the north star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when mr bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice. 52.87863570446568
 this was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did. 29.05553576500717
 so, bevelling around by mullett’s and the signal house which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of amiens street railway terminus, mr bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance. 73.0276370256035
 so as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of jupiter pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. 36.21319197826327
 as it so happened a dublin united tramways company’s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion  à  propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. 28.138749235221617
 they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway station, the starting point for belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course turned into store street, famous for its c division police station. 113.54735175755859
 between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of beresford place stephen thought to think of ibsen, associated with baird’s the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his  fidus  achates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of james rourke’s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable. 83.75780700397026
 bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, o tell me where is fancy bread, at rourke’s the baker’s it is said. 22.555885578342686
  en  route to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion mr bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution  re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn’t look out. 130.06945626931608
 highly providential was the appearance on the scene of corny kelleher when stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before mr tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old wall, he meant to say, or mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. 67.18620036219183
 the reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the crown and, as mr bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. 48.60597768680521
 never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes. 42.64959865896181
 another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything. 31.555549823109654
 you frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the  demimonde ran away with a lot of £. 43.78835692328468
 into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically. 93.6920153223861
 most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of stephen by all his pubhunting  confrères but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs. 30.44170738804408
  and that one was judas, stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind. 24.644875088587114
 discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps. 24.157517146971962
 stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. 27.80307203700352
 he began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a  quondam friend of his father’s, gumley. 33.02082257770816
 to avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge. 4.453405116885896
  someone saluted you, mr bloom said. 2.8867963167982276
 a figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling:  night! stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment. 29.197256318733256
 mr bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the  qui  vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least. 31.576128958218373
 though unusual in the dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment’s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted. 82.04043103381368
 stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised corley’s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice. 32.60518898836268
 lord john corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise. 12.375349214113978
 he was the eldest son of inspector corley of the g division, lately deceased, who had married a certain katherine brophy, the daughter of a louth farmer. 19.354411857087026
 his grandfather patrick michael corley of new ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine (also) talbot. 18.16319941579343
 rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords talbot de malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. 72.36055494262612
 this therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as lord john corley. 48.68605628757315
 taking stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. 6.351871550324811
 not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings. 7.77502676690494
 his friends had all deserted him. 4.643267939245817
 furthermore he had a row with lenehan and called him to stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions. 18.07806049969937
 he was out of a job and implored of stephen to tell him where on god’s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do. 19.612736317628453
 no, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish. 29.43503719851092
 anyhow he was all in. 2.0491664007086206
  i wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and god knows i’m on the rocks. 15.665584140320101
  there’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, stephen told him, in a boys’ school at dalkey for a gentleman usher. 15.11132311508851
 mr garrett deasy. 64.27756237583453
 try it. 1.0
 you may mention my name. 1.4119235952573665
  ah, god, corley replied, sure i couldn’t teach in a school, man. 10.116432690288068
 i was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. 7.317205887109491
 i got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers. 2.735600556795831
  i have no place to sleep myself, stephen informed him. 5.8027533638180335
 corley at the first go off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street. 26.490846193539944
 there was a dosshouse in marlborough street, mrs maloney’s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but m’conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over in winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar bacon) for a bob. 28.40530392258197
 he was starving too though he hadn’t said a word about it. 8.69424635291309
 though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence. 50.25012197273117
 however  haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco  etcetera as the latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. 40.42574849844767
 but the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of corley’s head that he was living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful. 19.64227712842071
 he put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing. 35.15081272124679
 a few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation. 5.245501201293107
 he tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact. 22.405062210231264
 he was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect. 22.677296816264313
 about biscuits he dimly remembered. 9.770325302448443
 who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy. 15.65835880474871
 however in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out. 14.421737233134806
  those are halfcrowns, man, corley corrected him. 10.286788650499
 and so in point of fact they turned out to be. 3.8992725850570293
 stephen anyhow lent him one of them. 3.5394773089642317
  thanks, corley answered, you’re a gentleman. 18.500750868829776
 i’ll pay you back one time. 2.3963914355654787
 who’s that with you? i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse in camden street with boylan, the billsticker. 10.536237300918684
 you might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there. 6.149742841131069
 i’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks, man. 10.228534379765554
 god, you’ve to book ahead, man, you’d think it was for the carl rosa. 22.14861885502993
 i don’t give a shite anyway so long as i get a job, even as a crossing sweeper. 14.46786071993736
 subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags comisky that he said stephen knew well out of fullam’s, the shipchandler’s, bookkeeper there that used to be often round in nagle’s back with o’mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of tighe. 42.111494825179555
 anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable. 15.65320384763462
 mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while dublin slept. 49.63705175408252
 he threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at stephen’s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when. 31.086513551953278
 being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. 27.919348765237313
 palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very  rara  avis altogether. 50.350473506822475
 in any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. 17.54242928114228
 pretty thick that was certainly. 4.558372489237923
 the pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite. 20.53660640219305
 alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, stephen, that is:  he is down on his luck. 8.832693880179177
 he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman. 8.692748654307572
 at this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, mr bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana, moored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively:  everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. 50.53305312130713
 now you mention it his face was familiar to me. 6.3733647002346245
 but, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if i am not too inquisitive?  half a crown, stephen responded. 15.768082710834502
 i daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere. 3.2277655624371855
  needs! mr bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, i can quite credit the assertion and i guarantee he invariably does. 19.177607375384408
 everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds. 6.9617037151772205
 but, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself? walking to sandycove is out of the question. 19.297224421740843
 and even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred at westland row station. 20.318012185737423
 simply fag out there for nothing. 3.00224043264775
 i don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father’s house?  to seek misfortune, was stephen’s answer. 17.816658257046353
  i met your respected father on a recent occasion, mr bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday. 18.13220476683931
 where does he live at present? i gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved. 10.509050367886681
  i believe he is in dublin somewhere, stephen answered unconcernedly. 2.865019657143525
 why?  a gifted man, mr bloom said of mr dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born  raconteur if ever there was one. 16.28982745633085
 he takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you. 10.039640936077687
 you could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at westland row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, mulligan, that is, and that english tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did. 54.471252046636415
 there was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy, boody and katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that. 115.34936920455242
  no, mr bloom repeated again, i wouldn’t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, dr mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if i were in your shoes. 30.509775326657515
 he knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals. 18.519210996586892
 of course you didn’t notice as much as i did. 5.2759662700857195
 but it wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object. 20.552409625028897
  except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out. 9.775041238274444
 the guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at stephen’s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less. 83.22030968571097
 grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet. 27.88330892478134
 adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties. 27.92217924902857
 — puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! ho ragione? culo rotto!_ _ intendiamoci. 30.340240953431802
 mezzo sovrano più. 2.018078973121994
_ _ dice lui, però!_ _ mezzo. 5.964365720753076
_ _ farabutto! mortacci sui!_ _ ma ascolta! cinque la testa più. 26.06715752896056
_ mr bloom and stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous skin thegoat fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. 62.08157566086216
 a few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus  homo already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity. 49.523704630951315
  now touching a cup of coffee, mr bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description. 31.021734551429002
 accordingly his first act was with characteristic  sangfroid to order these commodities quietly. 23.24494881081819
 the  hoi  polloi of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor. 55.44956542100551
 mr bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over  voglio, remarked to his  protégé in an audible tone of voice  à  propos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious:  a beautiful language. 56.31687817731424
 i mean for singing purposes. 3.5124312975644507
 why do you not write your poetry in that language?  bella  poetria! it is so melodious and full. 11.13624903146915
_ stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied:  to fill the ear of a cow elephant. 35.13584176039258
 they were haggling over money. 3.149332280483616
  is that so? mr bloom asked. 2.290352724960955
 of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it. 41.15370597809171
 the keeper of the shelter in the middle of this  tête à tête put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed. 33.795873012793685
 after which he beat a retreat to his counter, mr bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to. 16.47193760991156
 for which reason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him. 49.538458259823706
  sounds are impostures, stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names. 11.200643485902635
 cicero, podmore, napoleon, mr goodbody. 4.715129399695472
 jesus, mr doyle. 1.3216724799631678
 shakespeares were as common as murphies. 8.802538345679581
 what’s in a name?  yes, to be sure, mr bloom unaffectedly concurred. 5.373011187210761
 of course. 1.0
 our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across. 9.672737106151882
 the redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking:  and what might your name be? just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companion’s boot but stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered:  dedalus. 44.913663183018315
 the sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old hollands and water. 19.10565200508157
  you know simon dedalus? he asked at length. 6.044784644935276
  i’ve heard of him, stephen said. 1.9325463218855137
 mr bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too. 7.853639096839555
  he’s irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding. 41.4814412571561
 all irish. 1.0
  all too irish, stephen rejoined. 3.9513267111968564
 as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark:  i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder. 48.094625026711924
 the lefthand dead shot. 9.980294099605263
 though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain. 12.703577219201549
  bottles out there, say. 3.1998578985240957
 fifty yards measured. 55.1309046903918
 eggs on the bottles. 1.3036442468357174
 cocks his gun over his shoulder. 2.1847607294324662
 he turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. 11.193246721959392
 then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance. 20.38566914759161
  pom! he then shouted once. 12.512328141046714
 the entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg. 22.002009581634567
  pom! he shouted twice. 4.23121969480587
 egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily: _ buffalo bill shoots to kill, never missed nor he never will. 26.259798726202106
_ a silence ensued till mr bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the bisley. 17.86085944522565
  beg pardon, the sailor said. 5.529204723768425
  long ago? mr bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth. 3.394939089799032
  why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. 20.1911135499284
 he toured the wide world with hengler’s royal circus. 7.79249043624849
 i seen him do that in stockholm. 5.214093071368843
  curious coincidence, mr bloom confided to stephen unobtrusively. 3.4878631939531908
  murphy’s my name, the sailor continued. 2.4550332571711526
 murphy of carrigaloe. 1.0463412408808161
 know where that is?  queenstown harbour, stephen replied. 3.6104719768563767
  that’s right, the sailor said. 2.0362505168002687
 fort camden and fort carlisle. 6.760587517980408
 that’s where i hails from. 1.4034147375605182
 i belongs there. 1.4713057238241112
 that’s where i hails from. 1.4034147375605182
 my little woman’s down there. 7.3135316047487375
 she’s waiting for me, i know. 1.5875205908365881
  for england, home and  beauty. 4.000482964518625
 she’s my own true wife i haven’t seen for seven years now, sailing about. 9.524348886594844
 mr bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled davy jones, a rainy night with a blind moon. 25.809564867737215
 across the world for a wife. 1.9803576094101503
 quite a number of stories there were on that particular alice ben bolt topic, enoch arden and rip van winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember caoc o’leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor john casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way. 55.07747143755829
 never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. 7.576109887093114
 the face at the window! judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections. 39.23223831335767
 you little expected me but i’ve come to stay and make a fresh start. 8.414470628463368
 there she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside. 6.436035930842301
 believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep. 5.378487809246778
 and there sits uncle chubb or tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the crown and anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions. 15.540105560500526
 no chair for father. 2.7963565023669825
 broo! the wind! her brandnew arrival is on her knee,  post  mortem child. 14.19812597742826
 with a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, o! bow to the inevitable. 21.016298005205254
 grin and bear it. 3.4770943356801656
 i remain with much love your brokenhearted husband w. 8.386267160138908
 the sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:  you don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you? the jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand. 42.49497694926674
  thank you, the sailor said. 1.8777320105676638
 he deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded:  we come up this morning eleven o’clock. 23.51388255683611
 the threemaster  rosevean from bridgwater with bricks. 3.8788314148027085
 i shipped to get over. 1.98856319717328
 paid off this afternoon. 1.496348865672832
 there’s my discharge. 1.1642786907779146
 see? d. 1.0983993583894447
 in confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document. 31.913061470028595
  you must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter. 4.341684733500028
  why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, i’ve circumnavigated a bit since i first joined on. 16.59235123695019
 i was in the red sea. 3.495492079608017
 i was in china and north america and south america. 31.677626886172636
 we was chased by pirates one voyage. 6.039279725755516
 i seen icebergs plenty, growlers. 4.315741846851519
 i was in stockholm and the black sea, the dardanelles under captain dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship. 24.714285404412546
 i seen russia. 2.391562562084123
  gospodi  pomilyou. 1.0
 that’s how the russians prays. 3.765568580644342
  you seen queer sights, don’t be talking, put in a jarvey. 7.92490899715725
  why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. 9.961199071303989
 i seen queer things too, ups and downs. 4.568646231417425
 i seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as i chew that quid. 40.326826328427444
 he took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously:  khaan! like that. 15.948033953132782
 and i seen maneaters in peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses. 16.351682792614703
 look here. 1.0
 here they are. 1.0836868543141307
 a friend of mine sent me. 1.6370501776313673
 he fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table. 15.410595740911617
 the printed matter on it stated:  choza de indios. 12.990709632551937
 beni, bolivia. 1.3111834184289106
_ all focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier. 38.39608110773571
  chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. 6.786526871007323
 stomachs like breadgraters. 2.0776386793812
 cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more children. 4.306158170134082
 see them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver raw. 20.83439162095805
 his postcard proved a centre of attraction for messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more. 12.923508654488305
  know how to keep them off? he inquired generally. 3.6137990301529213
 nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:  glass. 5.4704096686787445
 that boggles ’em. 2.5800479184152603
 mr bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. 32.385858158490706
 it ran as follows:  tarjeta postal, señor a boudin, galeria becche, santiago, chile. 31.715706180548032
_ there was no message evidently, as he took particular notice. 7.1506529016421405
 though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite william tell and the lazarillo don cesar de bazan incident depicted in  maritana on which occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q. 82.74909630219402
 somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s  bona  fides nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some wednesday or saturday of travelling to london  via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to holyhead which was his longest. 87.67030806233585
 martin cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through. 19.181378169335925
 but even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking boyd’s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back. 50.10564266761227
 the trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, plymouth, falmouth, southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of park lane to renew acquaintance with. 87.99900333758434
 another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, eastbourne, scarborough, margate and so on, beautiful bournemouth, the channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative. 62.23435194418573
 not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness mrs c p m’coy type lend me your valise and i’ll post you the ticket. 81.94876703810866
 no, something top notch, an all star irish caste, the tweedy flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the elster grimes and moody manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure. 89.91994081602931
 but who? that was the rub. 2.4555655125126257
 also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times  apropos of the fishguard rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the  tapis in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally. 57.05205310103873
 a great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i. 16.448439050108
 brown, robinson and co. 18.25789212320318
 it was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick inthe mud took me for a wife. 68.88507887610454
 after all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of  venue after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life. 60.488148054120444
 because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired. 26.855324169941873
 interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. 24.71595556673722
 he turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to stephen. 10.878387351091128
  i seen a chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different. 26.9787206544216
 one was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower. 8.431575203389835
 cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does. 8.311852318200085
 possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures. 13.47354206474043
  and i seen a man killed in trieste by an italian chap. 3.7752438572799956
 knife in his back. 1.343242602285384
 knife like that. 1.2995380891985817
 whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position. 20.80911566921184
  in a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. 6.744277735422107
 fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. 5.656611363172512
 like that. 1.0
  prepare to meet your  god, says he. 1.8289385468381683
 chuk! it went into his back up to the butt. 5.106052982859011
 his heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to. 25.538837517955127
  that’s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable  stiletto. 9.358078113778413
 after which harrowing  dénouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket. 37.34826864180018
  they’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all. 17.108564836771478
 that was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives. 9.209497410032137
 at this remark passed obviously in the spirit of  where ignorance is  bliss mr b. 16.386128894796546
 and stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly  entre  nous variety however, towards where skin thegoat,  alias the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. 49.69546827787713
 his inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on. 14.15319960162003
 funny, very! there ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. 71.39293448720026
 one man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the natives  choza  de, another the seaman’s discharge. 92.29130018676554
 mr bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. 9.47955714600097
 he vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen. 47.40868506955155
  ay, boss, the sailor broke in. 2.4999074399298475
 give us back them papers. 12.27380132744761
 the request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape. 7.604680296511029
  have you seen the rock of gibraltar? mr bloom inquired. 2.875052883188846
 the sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no. 10.141990024495662
  ah, you’ve touched there too, mr bloom said, europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn. 32.56232206497277
  what year would that be about? mr b interrogated. 9.063385821728584
 can you recall the boats? our   soi disant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering:  i’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships. 31.080661467968557
 salt junk all the time. 3.5931131168933845
 tired seemingly, he ceased. 8.148206281814966
 his questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves. 45.79376664036562
 on more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings. 57.92796261013294
 and it left him wondering why. 5.369004773305449
 possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates. 22.725601776970585
 and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all. 9.304044952310567
  there was a fellow sailed with me in the  rover, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s valet at six quid a month. 25.45063205990042
 them are his trousers i’ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. 9.71307153222547
 i’m game for that job, shaving and brushup. 4.728368820964335
 i hate roaming about. 2.7797369800378613
 there’s my son now, danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in cork where he could be drawing easy money. 19.36170291986144
  what age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage. 49.31348648850395
  why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, danny? he’d be about eighteen now, way i figure it. 27.76244826610624
 the skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue chinese ink intended to represent an anchor. 50.37386267921683
  there was lice in that bunk in bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts. 16.125284415183337
 i must get a wash tomorrow or next day. 3.9625650243368025
 it’s them black lads i objects to. 5.951190004600364
 i hate those buggers. 1.9032989026081633
 suck your blood dry, they does. 6.194496509575605
 seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure Number and a young man’s sideface looking frowningly rather. 32.529612640900154
  tattoo, the exhibitor explained. 4.415110645414905
 that was done when we were lying becalmed off odessa in the black sea under captain dalton. 14.303640833896385
 fellow, the name of antonio, done that. 9.960100547597643
 there he is himself, a greek. 2.5385043777616088
  did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor. 9.680139400276037
 that worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the. 11.186859296438685
 someway in his. 1.3507464744320936
 squeezing or. 1.0
  see here, he said, showing antonio. 3.891227181443419
 there he is cursing the mate. 3.707725285207224
 and there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn. 15.975215483583442
 and in point of fact the young man named antonio’s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including skin thegoat, who this time stretched over. 56.37682772620863
  ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. 13.334553913887515
 he’s gone too. 2.0453942856408163
 ate by sharks after. 4.295523430831471
 ay, ay. 1.0153300499024582
 he let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before. 14.339074142086984
  neat bit of work, one longshoreman said. 14.383010778707463
  and what’s the number for? loafer number two queried. 12.219455449406848
  eaten alive? a third asked the sailor. 7.008176696291966
  ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number. 18.903522683592367
 a greek he was. 2.6704646819253317
 and then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end:  as bad as old antonio, for he left me on my ownio. 11.985899367973838
 the face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. 28.27708940209946
 mr bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink. 65.26818948779649
 his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (mrs b. 44.75836662019615
) and begged the chance of his washing. 4.328035863613306
 also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing. 34.060532043646035
 still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in holles street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled with bewley and draper’s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. 48.875176097295295
 still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off. 25.620281983669393
 round the side of the  evening  telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more of her. 30.49980907413842
  the gunboat, the keeper said. 2.8875006433105317
  it beats me, mr bloom confided to stephen, medically i am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least. 48.9057431385577
 unfortunate creature! of course i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition. 9.112987255074456
 still no matter what the cause is from. 8.507874112211837
 stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:  in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade. 21.222554586871738
 fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul. 13.207193265698095
 she is a bad merchant. 4.216238391234128
 she buys dear and sells cheap. 8.29253272458592
 the elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to  instanter to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a  paterfamilias, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start. 72.04845703705534
 whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned. 34.61329911322833
  you as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul. 13.238381721632983
 or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. 23.708168106326486
 i believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter. 7.637089238640213
 otherwise we would never have such inventions as x rays, for instance. 8.362165948461447
 do you? thus cornered, stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say:  they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible. 20.51064131490369
 it would be immortal, i understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its first cause who, from all i can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other practical jokes,  corruptio per  se and  corruptio per  accidens both being excluded by court etiquette. 44.04335513067884
 mr bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:  simple? i shouldn’t think that is the proper word. 44.124269508586536
 of course, i grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon. 14.747469248740618
 but what i am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays röntgen did or the telescope like edison, though i believe it was before his time galileo was the man, i mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god. 46.495827897936906
  o that, stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in holy writ, apart from circumstantial evidence. 17.274803405166622
 on this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed. 29.662554973370728
  has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief. 12.557524151980953
 i’m not so sure about that. 2.403111098271357
 that’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, i beg to differ with you  in  toto there. 15.3432283031278
 my belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like  hamlet and bacon, as, you who know your shakespeare infinitely better than i, of course i needn’t tell you. 52.78179100953416
 can’t you drink that coffee, by the way? let me stir it. 24.66970309953251
 and take a piece of that bun. 2.0195345144060526
 it’s like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised. 3.576470601980854
 still no one can give what he hasn’t got. 7.37547796687541
 try a bit. 1.1834413047796115
  couldn’t, stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further. 20.627847916595535
 faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat mr bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the coffee palace and its temperance (and lucrative) work. 35.58336737068762
 to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders. 53.80386765992274
 on the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, madam marion tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying. 15.43948766165748
 the idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of. 24.604998936269276
 sulphate of copper poison soNumber or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when it was or where. 29.66857052623038
 anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of dr tibble’s vi cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved. 35.143878056028456
  have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred. 9.082845794417961
 thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage. 32.38907325632152
  still it’s solid food, his good genius urged, i’m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the  sine qua  non for any kind of proper work, mental or manual. 56.32838911012372
 you ought to eat more solid food. 3.600911276185191
 you would feel a different man. 2.5838638677184003
  liquids i can eat, stephen said. 3.2712130398004473
 but o, oblige me by taking away that knife. 10.674810532666559
 i can’t look at the point of it. 1.313761768989955
 it reminds me of roman history. 3.184877204115599
 mr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it. 78.01920876778061
  our mutual friend’s stories are like himself, mr bloom  apropos of knives remarked to his  confidante sotto  voce. 16.070705565702948
 do you think they are genuine? he could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots. 11.77579861937519
 look at him. 1.0742087816658943
 yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel. 60.32311812772521
 he had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. 14.901150722056787
 though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. 55.28044980603061
 he might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. 58.16490697526889
 on the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner  hesperus and etcetera. 38.964483235913306
 and when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him. 34.60764701810584
  mind you, i’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed. 8.581545289575207
 analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. 12.362940693546
 giants, though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, marcella the midget queen. 25.883132664631542
 in those waxworks in henry street i myself saw some aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn’t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods. 43.72494432777746
 there’s an example again of simple souls. 4.936678543692945
 however reverting to friend sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of ludwig,  alias ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the gaiety when michael gunn was identified with the management in the  flying  dutchman, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded. 94.52414624836351
 on the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little italy there near the coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic  de  rigueur off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap. 99.81471627143729
  spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as old nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen. 21.22985219875064
 it comes from the great heat, climate generally. 4.270637675754424
 my wife is, so to speak, spanish, half that is. 6.279263890040589
 point of fact she could actually claim spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) spain, i. 12.329370757544451
 she has the spanish type. 18.43678612504652
 quite dark, regular brunette, black. 5.837834170017352
 i for one certainly believe climate accounts for character. 22.468215069936225
 that’s why i asked you if you wrote your poetry in italian. 3.4535481366562952
  the temperaments at the door, stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings. 14.233942498078827
  roberto ruba roba  sua. 3.1800695582416947
  quite so, mr bloom dittoed. 5.780007223068538
  then, stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of dante and the isosceles triangle miss portinari he fell in love with and leonardo and san tommaso mastino. 24.400872166650803
  it’s in the blood, mr bloom acceded at once. 3.7079432621087016
 all are washed in the blood of the sun. 1.5190642230499352
 coincidence i just happened to be in the kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if i can so call it, and i was just looking at those antique statues there. 24.978517089055398
 the splendid proportions of hips, bosom. 12.13205467169615
 you simply don’t knock against those kind of women here. 6.607234733747399
 an exception here and there. 3.172157848400321
 handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what i’m talking about is the female form. 9.212907346288352
 besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman’s natural beauty, no matter what you say. 25.504576861337664
 rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it’s a thing i simply hate to see. 10.441811870106243
 interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. 34.23662194838886
 shipahoy of course had his own say to say. 4.554420398769668
 he had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the china seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him. 37.518191233308
 so then after that they drifted on to the wreck off daunt’s rock, wreck of that illfated norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of henry campbell remembered it  palme on booterstown strand. 39.93544537849073
 that was the talk of the town that year (albert william quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the irish  times), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror. 38.52962399461799
 then someone said something about the case of the s. 2.808432459315065
  lady  cairns of swansea run into by the  mona which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. 29.532708565212584
 no aid was given. 1.495357099588327
 her master, the  mona’s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. 10.719299024275857
 she had no water, it appears, in her hold. 8.571483784350283
 at this stage an incident happened. 15.174552633029588
 it having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat. 14.655228494051448
  let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze. 10.679585394903018
 he made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left. 38.556870660781506
 while he was in the act of getting his bearings mr bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise. 55.01196571956562
 the irrepressible bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. 64.63861971960975
 some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. 69.97441056642514
 a hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. 57.93675062655063
 slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by pat tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ Number a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of. 160.33551654718573
 and there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver. 16.528471383828578
 he drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if a big if, however he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality. 29.8936778542866
 all meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing. 30.44663321689871
 a palgrave murphy boat was put off the ways at alexandra basin, the only launch that year. 41.76570081708603
 right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called. 15.356322919115232
 there were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently  au  fait. 10.022727275207123
 what he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in galway bay when the galway harbour scheme was mooted by a mr worthington or some name like that, eh? ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the british government gave him for that day’s work, captain john lever of the lever line. 60.518013386271804
  am i right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions. 13.072312032961579
 that worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds. 28.98579314144373
 mr bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. 30.822373624777775
 anyhow in he rolled after his successful  libation cum potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the  soirée, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:  the biscuits was as hard as brass and the beef as salt as lot’s wife’s arse. 46.52447935060935
 o, johnny lever! johnny lever, o! after which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided. 25.705664677813278
 skin thegoat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible feeble philippic anent the natural resources of ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of god’s earth, far and away superior to england, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by england levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein. 117.76717468090969
 their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact. 17.87438808665672
 you could grow any mortal thing in irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel everard down there in navan growing tobacco. 9.56600432674253
 where would you find anywhere the like of irish bacon? but a day of reckoning, he stated  crescendo with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty england, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes. 31.529225469014815
 there would be a fall and the greatest fall in history. 4.32597568450776
 the germans and the japs were going to have their little lookin, he affirmed. 4.187992872199599
 the boers were the beginning of the end. 3.666521932655131
 brummagem england was toppling already and her downfall would be ireland, her achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of achilles, the greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. 46.21753118016583
 his advice to every irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for ireland and live for ireland. 12.675072526406852
 ireland, parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons. 11.539726563335408
 silence all round marked the termination of his  finale. 7.812833750989876
 the impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed. 9.797439973954445
  take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism. 29.808437849108717
 to which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view. 24.57255375698721
  who’s the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated. 12.556120927105576
 and the best jumpers and racers? and the best admirals and generals we’ve got? tell me that. 16.82400771605705
  the irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like campbell, facial blemishes apart. 22.51899132771151
  that’s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. 2.828557262302056
 the irish catholic peasant. 3.528817932445993
 he’s the backbone of our empire. 3.1841559564235196
 you know jem mullins? while allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no irishman worthy of his salt that served it. 57.80270085031613
 then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows. 29.573729929873153
 from inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite. 71.96158868713876
 it was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart. 84.6377449784661
 another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him irish soldiers had as often fought for england as against her, more so, in fact. 31.15182578017987
 and now, why? so the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game. 65.07976850029229
 and as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other person at all, he (b. 16.568839769338275
) couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like denis or peter carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. 50.74430206291628
 quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. 6.353722019504156
 in any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo skin theetcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome. 17.398426509785274
 he ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high. 7.837288189323053
 like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again. 27.31498288667639
 generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow. 18.56822473065629
 so similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that mr johnny lever got rid of some £. 11.367171806516644
 in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the  old  ireland tavern, come back to erin and so on. 17.202879060652428
 then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender. 22.067974390298158
  he took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, i let slip. 19.00108907001559
 he called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively. 4.1375642838299465
 so i without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his god, i mean christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality i’m not. 23.389016166305048
 that was one for him. 2.4225019829957137
 a soft answer turns away wrath. 3.8015044439251104
 he hadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone saw. 3.7748824465029633
 am i not right? he turned a long you are wrong gaze on stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly. 27.885709426266857
 — ex  quibus, stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing,  christus or bloom his name is or after all any other,  secundum  carnem. 26.591167685554492
  of course, mr b. 1.7101803735532601
 proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question. 8.217900804847625
 it is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves. 43.58604339751726
 but with a little goodwill all round. 4.168189864258411
 it’s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality. 10.757882192633403
 i resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form. 7.820879861261168
 it never reaches anything or stops anything. 4.936551389157965
 a revolution must come on the due instalments plan. 6.610689222986298
 it’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak. 22.326120377136064
  memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war, stephen assented, between skinner’s alley and ormond market. 14.853448360352342
 yes, mr bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was overwhelmingly right. 15.187949268736952
 and the whole world was full of that sort of thing. 4.879857358049066
  you just took the words out of my mouth, he said. 3.492343398867659
 a hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely. 11.3603866571911
 all those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop. 75.86761071719195
  they accuse, remarked he audibly. 6.057236830566202
 he turned away from the others, who probably… and spoke nearer to, so as the others… in case they…  jews, he softly imparted in an aside in stephen’s ear, are accused of ruining. 47.75619551004424
 not a vestige of truth in it, i can safely say. 7.783540846246007
 history, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and england prospered when cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them. 81.77037513125583
 why? because they are imbued with the proper spirit. 4.3727845778345324
 they are practical and are proved to be so. 9.803876224158591
 i don’t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are. 9.078922311510789
 but in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty. 20.861031837257475
 spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead america. 17.763075766502794
 it’s in the dogma. 1.1940674741859956
 because if they didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d try to live better, at least so i think. 11.800069012507386
 that’s the juggle on which the p. 4.200178391736235
’s raise the wind on false pretences. 8.939748547133785
 i’m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an irishman as that rude person i told you about at the outset and i want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes  pro  rata having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £ Number per annum. 54.32927242644358
 that’s the vital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man. 18.50051753467815
 at least that’s my idea for what it’s worth. 3.2900097797462036
 i call that patriotism. 1.3421919621251277
  ubi  patria, as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in  alma mater, vita  bene. 14.475205103674277
 where you can live well, the sense is, if you work. 4.491831588572829
 over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, stephen stared at nothing in particular. 10.437532145305317
 he could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to. 26.26358097858236
 then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work. 18.570164211756794
  count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work. 25.46640013630035
 the eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who owned them pro tem. 8.588923328721526
 observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together. 36.24867459988933

 you have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has. 10.70659652653578
 what? you both belong to ireland, the brain and the brawn. 6.209717697073595
 each is equally important. 4.205561471357873
  you suspect, stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that i may be important because i belong to the  faubourg saint  patrice called ireland for short. 23.282928735032886
  i would go a step farther, mr bloom insinuated. 4.39488910717907
  but i suspect, stephen interrupted, that ireland must be important because it belongs to me. 11.58075981680706
  what belongs, queried mr bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension. 18.820943416802535
 excuse me. 1.0
 unfortunately, i didn’t catch the latter portion. 2.7582050101814333
 what was it you. 3.984186197411725
? stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:  we can’t change the country. 13.166983843173607
 let us change the subject. 2.2148400174848795
 at this pertinent suggestion mr bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. 26.599156144899997
 the rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part. 6.15383979529918
 needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state. 28.924790338828224
 probably the homelife to which mr b attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people. 21.96867905598311
 with a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves. 53.527187627916064
 for instance there was the case of o’callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact). 55.652126128712396
 and then the usual  dénouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from john mallon of lower castle yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains. 70.58209888017308

 still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small. 33.30812750621854
 intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind. 20.49652313741287

 highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered. 24.231057510207656
 something evidently riled them in his death. 8.986095914993463
 either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands. 74.77019951630591
 of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the  alice, where art  thou order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as fox and stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility. 64.62330584494443
 naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas messrs so and so who, though they weren’t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between. 77.535769215481

 a more prudent course, as bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first. 49.624385314579065

 this gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his  entourage. 13.826664179077522
 as regards bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings. 53.27489173830419
 first it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into. 68.26359197524857
 since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of. 136.02022734030632
 whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one’s smiles. 71.85761865538541
 the eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up. 6.467087732401052

 though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly. 7.997911659588615
 looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream. 16.868568014018894
 and then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times. 26.744572219250145
 why, as he reflected, irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side. 42.13678724108993
 north or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was spanish or half so, types that wouldn’t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds. 59.884879679175285
  just bears out what i was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to stephen, about blood and the sun. 16.146480989909826
 and, if i don’t greatly mistake she was spanish too. 30.052480756233347
  the king of spain’s daughter, stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you spanish onions and the first land called the deadman and from ramhead to scilly was so and so many. 39.60753386899302
  was she? bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means, i never heard that rumour before. 18.17169723628662
 possible, especially there, it was as she lived there. 8.037371535746406
 so, spain. 4.079494836444964
 carefully avoiding a book in his pocket  sweets  of, which reminded him by the by of that capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he. 42.1331008938952
  do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a spanish type? stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was  in old  madrid, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. 111.70698733228416
 her (the lady’s) eyes, dark, large, looked at stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, lafayette of westmoreland street, dublin’s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution. 33.24159409659019

 very like her then. 1.8195928133276746
 beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of major brian tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen. 54.23806560498315
 as for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup. 29.268984761326525
 she could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the. 23.48215449745064
 he dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the national museum. 36.574179703123676

 yes, puritanisme, it does though, saint joseph’s sovereign thievery alors (bandez!) figne toi trop. 19.759857038750734
 whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word. 11.524846148486002
 the spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow jack tar’s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to. 57.365444649351076
 but it was scarcely professional etiquette so. 7.9973594918684485
 though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm. 37.478033056560925
 and he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion. 22.34796308039147
 nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving  embonpoint. 122.26287862973491
 in fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out. 36.035783769291314
 suppose she was gone when he? i looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about ruby with met him pike hoses ( sic) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to lindley murray. 47.14097952746177
 the vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,  distingué and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would. 23.09653001313198
 besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter. 23.326098502513137
 and why not? an awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business. 62.09071750321985
 how they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate. 78.43561569697961
 then the decree  nisi and the king’s proctor tries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it,  nisi was made absolute. 40.41929132590739
 but as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course. 59.05029448790238
 he, b, enjoyed the distinction of being close to erin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic  fracas when the fallen leader’s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader’s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the  insuppressible or no it was  united  ireland (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the o’brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals. 107.34413346047187
 though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive. 77.54542590365975
 as those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character. 39.05811111524559
 he personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many  liaisons between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt. 156.5189329751917
 it was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime. 50.377980063195224
 in the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a  conditio sine qua  non though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump stephen about miss ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and chocs. 131.57153165093152
 to think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age. 12.728097773425867
 the queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely humpty dumpty boiled. 49.97962106578422
  at what o’clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face. 15.093901693966254
  some time yesterday, stephen said. 2.5317578638788167
  yesterday! exclaimed bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow friday. 42.0092854995104
 ah, you mean it’s after twelve!  the day before yesterday, stephen said, improving on himself. 11.225323289603743
 literally astounded at this piece of intelligence bloom reflected. 5.166643263233998
 though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought. 37.36004953134478
 at his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a  quasi aspirant to parliamentary honours in the buckshot foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. 48.565078175103174
 anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night. 15.880990686594492
 the crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to ontario terrace as he very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. 58.08660050912397
 on the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the sandymount or sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives. 22.364929528631862
 everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered. 11.597584529026884
 his initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway. 16.849942629685756
 for one thing he mightn’t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable. 63.29350831053434
 at all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up. 65.54592153432833
 a move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as mr algebra remarks  passim. 141.4370888284673
 at the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew. 14.613740704044794
 people could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep. 12.623417665785679
 the most vulnerable point too of tender achilles. 9.580444678295692
 your god was a jew. 1.140273256201952
 because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from carrick onshannon or somewhereabouts in the county sligo. 10.741770526087404
  i propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it’s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over. 36.29364324691694
 my diggings are quite close in the vicinity. 2.949617302128415
 you can’t drink that stuff. 1.6237927318557617
 do you like cocoa? wait. 2.9372334124487876
 i’ll just pay this lot. 2.7997451087601894
 the best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to. 26.623377934482637
  yes, that’s the best, he assured stephen to whom for the matter of that brazen head or him or anywhere else was all more or less. 19.158253213655932
 all kinds of utopian plans were flashing through his (b’s) busy brain, education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, up to date billing, concert tours in english watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it, and a slice of luck. 98.27275067903481
 an opening was all was wanted. 8.191306473875288
 because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to. 30.457013372068573
 the cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers’ association dinner in london somewhere. 32.88175481390747
 silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement. 22.449661318248147
 then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir anthony macdonnell had left euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to that effect. 28.217409537861702
 to which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why. 9.579508146200425
  give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience. 35.32258104699775
  and welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed. 106.61698001707308
 the sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears. 14.424364276598324
  are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried. 10.532165694333512
  why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, i uses goggles reading. 28.28214253720242
 sand in the red sea done that. 10.959455006880832
 one time i could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking. 9.01935737694665
  the arabian nights  entertainment was my favourite and  red as a rose is she. 19.573165006050154
_ hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of king willow, iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for notts, during which time (completely regardless of ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark. 126.80818387428256
 to cut a long story short bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee Numberd, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as wetherup used to remark. 157.51219587476965
  come, he counselled to close the  séance. 4.533530514429767
 seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the  élite society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their  dolce far  niente. 42.4145729350784
 stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door. 27.66159537485092
  one thing i never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment. 5.744450167534005
 why they put tables upside down at night, i mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafés. 17.932008888259364
 to which impromptu the neverfailing bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation, saying straight off:  to sweep the floor in the morning. 23.102241704496656
 so saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender achilles. 39.45591161418446
 the night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though stephen was a bit weak on his pins. 7.357571823574909
  it will (the air) do you good, bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment. 13.28355792552025
 the only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man. 4.081772244874713
 it’s not far. 2.0024374095547146
 lean on me. 1.3314056645951249
 accordingly he passed his left arm in stephen’s right and led him on accordingly. 9.832984084916067
  yes, stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that. 15.102478284449845
 anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. 3.5364501090479785
 where the municipal supernumerary, ex gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new. 34.58353441148698
 and  apropos of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings. 47.48553407322922
 so they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across beresford place. 31.95298719477549
 wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to follow at the first go off but the music of mercadante’s  huguenots, meyerbeer’s  seven last words on the  cross and mozart’s  twelfth  mass he simply revelled in, the  gloria in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat. 71.0182726333204
 he infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those moody and sankey hymns or  bid me to live and i will live thy protestant to  be. 35.69499785871342
 he also yielded to none in his admiration of rossini’s  stabat  mater, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, madam marion tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers’ church in upper gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or  virtuosi rather. 76.42342133290556
 there was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore. 24.66260654800099
 on the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the  don  giovanni description and  martha, a gem in its line, he had a  penchant, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as mendelssohn. 40.69042051158049
 and talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned  par  excellence lionel’s air in  martha, m’ appari, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of stephen’s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat. 93.8568126875123
 stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn’t sing it but launched out into praises of shakespeare’s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist dowland who lived in fetter lane near gerard the herbalist, who  anno ludendo hausi,  doulandus, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from mr arnold dolmetsch, whom b. 56.67993928843627
 did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and farnaby and son with their  dux and  comes conceits and byrd (william) who played the virginals, he said, in the queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one tomkins who made toys or airs and john bull. 55.005907316738394
 on the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and john bull. 69.65653031500517
 he inquired if it was john bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence. 25.379212305658015
 by the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other’s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:  our lives are in peril tonight. 66.24367919727568
 beware of the steamroller. 1.1540492401077702
 they thereupon stopped. 8.238143998387034
 bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. 52.27368681555298
 but such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up. 20.8660231765099
 he was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world. 12.265463021984138
 but even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in barney kiernan’s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face. 21.588341196175392
 but it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump. 24.424335345815717
 nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees. 12.411878057424042
 whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye. 27.015271133625888
 these timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from stephen’s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and stephen went on about the highly interesting old. 23.42989788117031
  what’s this i was saying? ah, yes! my wife, he intimated, plunging  in medias  res, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind. 22.171129106548022
 he looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built. 35.92835662895686
 still, supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind such as lady fingall’s irish industries, concert on the preceding monday, and aristocracy in general. 60.752462507346785
 exquisite variations he was now describing on an air  youth here has  end by jans pieter sweelinck, a dutchman of amsterdam where the frows come from. 30.811023692328313
 even more he liked an old german song of  johannes  jeep about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled bloom a bit: von der sirenen listigkeit tun die poeten dichten. 50.93156617726214
 these opening bars he sang and translated  extempore. 14.220038283711494
 bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did. 6.462403491388152
 a phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an  entrée into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of b. 84.11628891114228
 (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society’s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you. 85.77754697683483
 it was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic  conversaziones during the festivities of the christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record in fact, without giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. 52.06731272226126
 added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. 18.72028210891552
 not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time. 29.864341335083502
 but a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. 45.856710847345994
 besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for dublin’s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by ivan st austell and hilton st just and their  genus  omne. 71.33834400958649
 yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the king street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big  if, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows. 62.7540657421424
 and it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone. 50.81193706227859
 in fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all. 24.382217432798974
 the horse was just then. 1.37748677482412
 and later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the  fools step in where  angels principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person’s character, no pun intended. 89.77286039611141
 the horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds. 40.960120951116586
 slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired. 7.072900471822657
 and humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car. 15.291268510319608
 side by side bloom, profiting by the  contretemps, with stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards gardiner street lower, stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad. 44.0465066284464
 und alle schiffe brücken. 3.1800695582416947
 the driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge,  to be married by father  maher. 46.51265049397283
 as they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their  tête à  tête (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens, enemies of man’s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower gardiner street  and looked after their lowbacked  car. 74.4557176452474
 what parallel courses did bloom and stephen follow returning? starting united both at normal walking pace from beresford place they followed in the order named lower and middle gardiner streets and mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, temple street, north, as far as hardwicke place. 109.31859587283145
 approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before george’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends. 24.444940842481504
 of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary? music, literature, ireland, dublin, paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, stephen’s collapse. 80.3920840345378
 did bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience? both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plastic or pictorial. 47.37104107622468
 both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. 14.012574752343847
 both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. 46.1977270821977
 both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism. 12.520645677263255
 were their views on some points divergent? stephen dissented openly from bloom’s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while bloom dissented tacitly from stephen’s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. 36.67159583568051
 bloom assented covertly to stephen’s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the irish nation to christianity from druidism by patrick son of calpornus, son of potitus, son of odyssus, sent by pope celestine i in the year Number in the reign of leary to the year Number or thereabouts in the reign of cormac macart († Number a. 75.33169870512687
), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at sletty and interred at rossnaree. 11.536306524763685
 the collapse which bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation sandycove and dublin) at first no bigger than a woman’s hand. 66.25049106393881
 was there one point on which their views were equal and negative? the influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees. 28.083347677404106
 had bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past? in Number with owen goldberg and cecil turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between longwood avenue and leonard’s corner and leonard’s corner and synge street and synge street and bloomfield avenue. 74.26518822784874
 in Number with percy apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between gibraltar villa and bloomfield house in crumlin, barony of uppercross. 19.63696957329052
 in Number occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines. 29.260625501701934
 in Number frequently with major brian tweedy and his daughter miss marion tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in matthew dillon’s house in roundtown. 36.799593564468616
 once in Number and once in Number with julius (juda) mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (bloom’s) house in lombard street, west. 21.85743652108145
 what reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates Number, Number, Number, Number, Number, Number, Number did bloom make before their arrival at their destination? he reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations. 61.49908268124493
 as in what ways? from inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived. 75.40043411283322
 what act did bloom make on their arrival at their destination? at the housesteps of the Numberth of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number Number eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey. 27.357169840354608
 was it there? it was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding. 10.76630829163755
 why was he doubly irritated? because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget. 21.443863754484735
 what were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple? to enter or not to enter. 31.147767125869667
 to knock or not to knock. 1.9526340935537077
 bloom’s decision? a stratagem. 3.344708908045726
 resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall. 55.416237533806374
 did he fall? by his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of francis froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of Number frederick street, north, on the last feast of the ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of may of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number Number, epact Number, solar cycle Number, dominical letters c b, roman indiction Number, julian period Number, mcmiv. 194.58589533516334
 did he rise uninjured by concussion? regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle. 123.61847007488974
 what discrete succession of images did stephen meanwhile perceive? reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of Number cp, a man lighting a candle of Number cp, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle. 71.01403808912492
 did the man reappear elsewhere? after a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor. 30.358141472899806
 the halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. 4.685351655713224
 in the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle. 9.040807171124037
 did stephen obey his sign? yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of bloom’s house. 88.15360901200631
 what did bloom do? he extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of messrs flower and m’donald of Number d’olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air. 121.50092074869444
 what did stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall? under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies’ grey hose with lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction. 92.26204805643043
 what did bloom see on the range? on the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle. 31.498971162383427
 what did bloom do at the range? he removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow. 26.63873293215981
 did it flow? yes. 1.8740106325372923
 from roundwood reservoir in county wicklow of a cubic capacity of Number million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ Number per linear yard by way of the dargle, rathdown, glen of the downs and callowhill to the Number acre reservoir at stillorgan, a distance of Number statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of Number feet to the city boundary at eustace bridge, upper leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of Number Number/Number million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, mr spencer harty, c. 201.98979863294397
, on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the grand and royal canals as in Number) particularly as the south dublin guardians, notwithstanding their ration of Number gallons per day per pauper supplied through a Number inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of Number,Number gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, mr ignatius rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound. 106.02970504862135
 having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap? to wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of barrington’s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller. 141.93866806824911
 what reason did stephen give for declining bloom’s offer? that he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of october of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language. 72.4570684485862
 what impeded bloom from giving stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot? the incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius. 118.4209553561759
 what additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress? dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed. 47.99340015793533
 which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest? confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation. 20.040760310571706
 what concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire? the phenomenon of ebullition. 24.823820070685173
 fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether. 67.62410492555966
 heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of Number thermal units needed to raise Number pound of water from Number° to Number° fahrenheit. 148.6185882627036
 what announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature? a double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously. 21.7480666156717
 for what personal purpose could bloom have applied the water so boiled? to shave himself. 39.167600000753055
 what advantages attended shaving by night? a softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman’s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done. 167.44766715820958
 why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise? because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand. 37.30824907172137
 what quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence? the operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery. 53.369378550349325
 what lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser, opened by bloom? on the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of crown derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits. 129.04627536002565
 on the upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences. 14.938415611744636
 what attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser? four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered Number Number, Number Number. 34.59963234917095
 what reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow? reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the gold cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the  evening  telegraph, late pink edition, in the cabman’s shelter, at butt bridge. 44.03276089295287
 where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him? in bernard kiernan’s licensed premises Number, Number and Number little britain street: in david byrne’s licensed premises, Number duke street: in o’connell street lower, outside graham lemon’s when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising elijah, restorer of the church in zion: in lincoln place outside the premises of f. 94.3676641024562
 sweny and co (limited), dispensing chemists, when, when frederick m. 22.22411720819037
 (bantam) lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the  freeman’s  journal and  national  press which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the turkish and warm baths, Number leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction. 57.556508353917685
 what qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations? the difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation. 86.01897235910033
 his mood? he had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied. 8.960710603610151
 what satisfied him? to have sustained no positive loss. 37.57480765119641
 to have brought a positive gain to others. 3.552715434970943
 light to the gentiles. 1.311912025566425
 how did bloom prepare a collation for a gentile? he poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of epps’s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed. 58.65218549647448
 what supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest? relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation crown derby presented to him by his only daughter, millicent (milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife marion (molly). 115.5876742816299
 was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality? his attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence epps’s massproduct, the creature cocoa. 44.029503066554355
 were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun? the reparation of a fissure of the length of Number Number/Number inches in the right side of his guest’s jacket. 51.50830074913411
 a gift to his guest of one of the four lady’s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition. 16.5632287291986
 who drank more quickly? bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent’s one, six to two, nine to three. 45.17923649569832
 what cerebration accompanied his frequentative act? concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of william shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life. 61.467482850943064
 had he found their solution? in spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points. 32.663087119429875
 what lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of Number in Number on the occasion of the offering of three prizes of Number/-, Number/- and Number/Number respectively for competition by the  shamrock, a weekly newspaper? an ambition to squint at my verses in print makes me hope that for these you’ll find room. 94.07556982052695
 if you so condescend then please place at the end the name of yours truly, l. 11.255399198512876
 did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him? name, age, race, creed. 29.11762209083671
 what anagrams had he made on his name in youth? leopold bloom ellpodbomool molldopeloob bollopedoom old ollebo, m. 18.73385634636807
 what acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to miss marion (molly) tweedy on the Number february Number? poets oft have sung in rhyme of music sweet their praise divine. 73.98578791972648
 let them hymn it nine times nine. 4.711522361405524
 dearer far than song or wine. 7.38848834927944
 you are mine. 3.7829074771557734
 the world is mine. 1.0514424938265277
 what had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by r. 13.44931379285439
 johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled  if brian boru could but come back and see old dublin  now, commissioned by michael gunn, lessee of the gaiety theatre, Number, Number, Number, Number south king street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (Number january Number) of the grand annual christmas pantomime  sinbad the  sailor (produced by r. 93.9208717371289
 shelton Number december Number, written by greenleaf whittier, scenery by george a. 12.077500239635887
 what relation existed between their ages? Number years before in Number when bloom was of stephen’s present age stephen was Number. 29.92682395128651
 Number years after in Number when stephen would be of bloom’s present age bloom would be Number. 32.493033182652965
, bloom would have been obliged to have been alive Number,Number years, having been obliged to have been born in the year Number,Number b. 13.270835932965307
 what events might nullify these calculations? the cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable. 27.59125711691063
 how many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance? two. 16.78486079554337
 the first in the lilacgarden of matthew dillon’s house, medina villa, kimmage road, roundtown, in Number, in the company of stephen’s mother, stephen being then of the age of Number and reluctant to give his hand in salutation. 29.065337902724806
 the second in the coffeeroom of breslin’s hotel on a rainy sunday in the january of Number, in the company of stephen’s father and stephen’s granduncle, stephen being then Number years older. 34.62587108527629
 did bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father? very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined. 31.400439238346284
 did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them? mrs riordan (dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of stephen’s parents from Number september Number to Number december Number and had also resided during the years Number, Number and Number in the city arms hotel owned by elizabeth o’dowd of Number prussia street where, during parts of the years Number and Number, she had been a constant informant of bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of joseph cuffe of Number smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent dublin cattle market on the north circular road. 114.36266447635438
 had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her? he had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the north circular road opposite mr gavin low’s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the phoenix park and  vice  versa. 84.93619441184863
 why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity? because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe. 85.53751015071524
 what distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased? the older, her bezique cards and counters, her skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the immaculate conception, her green and maroon brushes for charles stewart parnell and for michael davitt, her tissue papers. 113.37357109148518
 were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable? the indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in eugen sandow’s  physical strength and how to obtain  it which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility. 107.2746197004393
 had any special agility been his in earlier youth? though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a high school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles. 65.62735872842886
 did either openly allude to their racial difference? neither. 6.289754390980923
 what, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were bloom’s thoughts about stephen’s thoughts about bloom and about stephen’s thoughts about bloom’s thoughts about stephen? he thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not. 26.431283643258002
 what, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages? bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of rudolf virag (subsequently rudolph bloom) of szombathely, vienna, budapest, milan, london and dublin and of ellen higgins, second daughter of julius higgins (born karoly) and fanny higgins (born hegarty). 75.01725839527653
 stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of simon dedalus of cork and dublin and of mary, daughter of richard and christina goulding (born grier). 61.15001219678913
 had bloom and stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman? bloom (three times), by the reverend mr gilmer johnston m. 49.79279417683509
, alone, in the protestant church of saint nicholas without, coombe, by james o’connor, philip gilligan and james fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of swords, and by the reverend charles malone c. 55.6069857917957

 it comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting. 27.950743768817848

 what second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly, if differently? a temporary departure of his cat. 34.95003767393592
 why similarly, why differently? similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male (mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). 47.959518298125495
 differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation. 11.819798405455524
 in other respects were their differences similar? in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness. 37.54531719506902
 as? inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf neckarching cat). 28.209667920414603
 moreover, on the free surface of the lake in stephen’s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat). 66.2305648167251

 furthermore, silly milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf hearthdreaming cat). 25.341237464305024
 hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar. 29.23508302282772
 in what way had he utilised gifts (Number) an owl, Number) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her? as object lessons to explain: Number) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: Number) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination,  videlicet, Number Number/Number minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression. 183.21437147183266

 for the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. 8.434134636715113
 for the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct italian pronunciation. 18.538785477020603
 why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s daughter? because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter. 42.44339820085645

 what rendered problematic for bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions? the irreparability of the past: once at a performance of albert hengler’s circus in the rotunda, rutland square, dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (bloom) was his (the clown’s) papa. 63.41259603228067
 the imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of Number he (bloom) had marked a florin (Number/-) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by j. 37.0437344431599
 and t. 1.0
 davy, family grocers, Number charlemont mall, grand canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return. 56.00337727277152
 was the clown bloom’s son? no. 3.5208104962371713
 had bloom’s coin returned? never. 12.130708755419864
 why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him? because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity. 33.178932419716276
 why did he desist from speculation? because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed. 18.181957846084465
 did stephen participate in his dejection? he affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void. 33.60503411401586
 was this affirmation apprehended by bloom? not verbally. 6.435586598997769
 what comforted his misapprehension? that as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void. 35.87181920601529
 in what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected? lighted candle in stick borne by bloom diaconal hat on ashplant borne by stephen with what intonation  secreto of what commemorative psalm? the Numberth,  modus peregrinus: in exitu israël de egypto: domus jacob de populo  barbaro. 82.75830814658465
 what did each do at the door of egress? bloom set the candlestick on the floor. 12.33739015318284
 stephen put the hat on his head. 3.2280061724138305
 for what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress? for a cat. 14.22631415398346
 what spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden? the heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit. 36.68386333838858
 why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result? because some years previously in Number when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e. 47.97186128833374
, the Numberth power of the Numberth power of Number, that, the result having been obtained, Number closely printed volumes of Number pages each of innumerable quires and reams of india paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers. 141.49578931028222
 did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution? of a different order of difficulty. 38.70841060217074
 and the problem of possible redemption? the minor was proved by the major. 14.867249869892827
 his (bloom’s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error? that it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman. 28.44177022383105
 that it was a utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence. 58.90637714174629
 was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle? indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet. 37.43586435714701
 did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters? it seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity. 41.808632873726516
 what visible luminous sign attracted bloom’s, who attracted stephen’s, gaze? in the second storey (rere) of his (bloom’s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by frank o’hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, Number aungier street. 158.1320837939387
 how did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wife marion (molly) bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp? with indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion. 76.41877837542891
 both then were silent? silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces. 23.75307886345816
 were they indefinitely inactive? at stephen’s suggestion, at bloom’s instigation both, first stephen, then bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first bloom’s, then stephen’s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow. 63.70961300932467
 similarly? the trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at high school (Number) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, Number scholars: stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure. 91.67107142107763
 what different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other? to bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity. 31.97199689234663
 to stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of jesus circumcised (Number january, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails. 67.99415044736365
 what celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed? a star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from vega in the lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the tress of berenice towards the zodiacal sign of leo. 38.20104445465939
 how did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer? by inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress. 87.48939093118256
 how did they take leave, one of the other, in separation? standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles. 40.68912074036744
 what sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands? the sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of saint george. 30.297610250858003
 what echoes of that sound were by both and each heard? by stephen: liliata rutilantium. 24.34440390284366

 by bloom: heigho, heigho, heigho, heigho. 4.297768646822602
 where were the several members of the company which with bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from sandymount in the south to glasnevin in the north? martin cunningham (in bed), jack power (in bed), simon dedalus (in bed), ned lambert (in bed), tom kernan (in bed), joe hynes (in bed), john henry menton (in bed), bernard corrigan (in bed), patsy dignam (in bed), paddy dignam (in the grave). 91.10241575071537
 alone, what did bloom hear? the double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew’s harp in the resonant lane. 31.486297623940363
 alone, what did bloom feel? the cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of fahrenheit, centigrade or réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn. 29.392129629511484
 of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him? of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: percy apjohn (killed in action, modder river), philip gilligan (phthisis, jervis street hospital), matthew f. 53.85529227780863
 kane (accidental drowning, dublin bay), philip moisel (pyemia, heytesbury street), michael hart (phthisis, mater misericordiae hospital), patrick dignam (apoplexy, sandymount). 44.092948048487706
 what prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain? the disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition of a new solar disk. 26.221373731136502
 had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena? once, in Number, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of luke doyle, kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of mizrach, the east. 34.711103005394236
 he remembered the initial paraphenomena? more active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon. 73.6018966933614
 did he remain? with deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door. 26.88508119093927
 with brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered. 21.720398021710533
 what suddenly arrested his ingress? the right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered. 50.88880788626805
 describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture. 14.017287442793299
 a sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled union jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table. 121.16095389126883
 describe them. 1.0
 one: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration. 86.59268366205328
 the other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush. 167.62956258715744
 what significances attached to these two chairs? significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence. 36.21514375717679
 what occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard? a vertical piano (cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of g natural for voice and piano of  love’s old sweet  song (words by g. 148.7890718827812

 with what sensations did bloom contemplate in rotation these objects? with strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering dr malachi mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration. 138.69129905041325
 his next proceeding? from an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled agendath netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion. 112.14073784411181
 what followed this operation? the truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense. 38.98359181006053
 what homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece? a timepiece of striated connemara marble, stopped at the hour of Decimal a. 24.81155570001693
 on the Number march Number, matrimonial gift of matthew dillon: a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of luke and caroline doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of alderman john hooper. 46.13968232198075
 what interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and bloom? in the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. 51.11271458660025
 before the mirror the matrimonial gift of alderman john hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded bloom while bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of luke and caroline doyle. 144.57549131155758
 what composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention? the image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man. 32.17258489728879
 why solitary (ipsorelative)? brothers and sisters had he none. 54.759180740747695
 yet that man’s father was his grandfather’s son. 5.92637250064103
 why mutable (aliorelative)? from infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix. 22.187293006466493
 from maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator. 13.277771493586126
 what final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror? the optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite. 43.60823179134903

 what reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the inverted volumes? the necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document behind, beneath or between the pages of a book. 77.08897798906476
