how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing. 3.6676410826703036

the discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly. 3.4404709250601093

Mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet. 3.9289894669048553

he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend. 3.3039997224383484
every object in the next day 's journey was new and interesting to elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight. 3.7094942538736837

" as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane. 3.6747310482058455
it was as follows : "my dear sir , "i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire. 3.3550969052341566

they could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr bingley 's large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign. 3.714876510451072
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same. 3.748062995623915
" "but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ?

she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents. 3.4909224439707724
she was engaged one day as she walked , in re perusing jane 's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her. 3.367844017783547

it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations. 3.594442332656636
elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them. 3.317353814604631

" and upon elizabeth 's seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , "lizzy , i insist upon your staying and hearing Mr collins. 2.9979805062640508
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your 's. 3.536813521890868
she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become "stupid , disagreeable fellows. 3.663428835628592
but really , ma 'am , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. 3.335844707770447
" "and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason. 3.3107282618026814
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement. 4.665177217897047
it was first broken by Mrs annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others ; and between her and Mrs gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on. 3.04266072335598
they had several children. 3.3524890311183637
" "yes ; he introduced us to his sister. 3.018906856801922
at length however Mrs bennet had no more to say ; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. 3.357610629801448
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection. 3.0950829509211566
"only think of its being three months , " she cried , "since i went away ; it seems but a fortnight i declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. 3.448592606462498
"you are quite a visit in my debt , Mr bingley , " she added , "for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned. 3.4503193324650643
"i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news. 3.5460965789110177
Mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast. 3.3683296089634527
she really looked almost wild. 3.673738855277914
one morning , about a week after bingley 's engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. 3.6615341688407312
kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. 3.7172327533107947
but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival of jane. 4.219369474461784
they were , therefore , to go. 3.7684228498011683
till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for Mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. 3.7422042142832805

she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject. 3.6777473928432607
we passed each other several times. 3.4174049061056895
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. 3.7932563951109546
no one but Mrs bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home. 3.587177084612097
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior. 3.080589756618444
my father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. 3.451819873811578
but perhaps Mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle. 3.5128443976957584
Mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant 's commission in the shire. 3.8940201068692972
" the gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes ; but , alas ! the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair. 3.830104965262865
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants. 3.9151209528163458
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. 3.536812845446164
"how can you be so silly , " cried her mother , "as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! you will not be fit to be seen when you get there. 3.869595940815854
how long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am i to wish you joy ? " "that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask. 3.221521673867244
"you certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome. 3.8592024367841486
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose. 3.5013680409681287
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. 3.6345753123710614
his plan did not vary on seeing them. 4.270350574888139
the day of his and lydia 's departure soon came , and Mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth. 3.6938925213361347
a lively imagination soon settled it all. 3.48809091098485
miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place. 3.363582798122667
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all. 3.3686705197528153
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine 's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte 's observation , and hurried her away to her room. 3.36031813370705
" "do you really think so ? " cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment. 3.6451759459021806
it settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts. 4.269752015529593
a clergyman like you must marry. 3.488665942847406
" "whatever i do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; "and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes. 3.571252077316873
" "oh ! no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. 2.9943789976475212
on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was. 3.780030175122989

" "i am far from attributing any part of Mr bingley 's conduct to design , " said elizabeth ; "but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery. 3.7128517066711675

elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother 's schemes. 3.649219220911811

" you began the evening well , charlotte , " said Mrs bennet with civil self command to miss lucas. 3.5291217034714597
had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend 's permission , or being bold enough to come without it. 3.884826646386995

- "whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment. 3.3424038376797647
to this speech bingley made no answer ; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend 's vulgar relations. 4.088714692337129
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday. 3.1821839036904365
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak. 3.884736087796989
smiles decked the face of Mrs bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy. 3.376806856547723
"i did not think caroline in spirits , " were her words , "but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london. 3.875085140147256
" Mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt 's ill breeding , and made no answer. 3.184068306957562
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin. 3.336109919018605
Mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. 3.55661636324765

perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. 2.8526239234194164
when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. 3.697521320470661

she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend 's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power. 3.791031729466642

" "good heavens ! " cried elizabeth ; "but how could that be ? how could his will be disregarded ? why did not you seek legal redress ? " "there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. 3.9616894516925405

amongst the most violent against him was Mrs bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters. 3.7765864928524038

" "it is amazing to me , " said bingley , "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are. 3.834294949036086
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield. 3.6455364209448406
"the first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , "is never more to be in company with either of them. 3.9409614933165784
when Mr bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn. 3.587389726656581
we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice. 3.28080466430995
Mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker. 3.7075505289244366

elizabeth 's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more. 3.6127191319961978
they were in fact very fine ladies ; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited. 3.217502419447877
" she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted. 4.052831012245615

wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say , three very silly sisters. 3.5448180046458
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent. 3.740715528643778
imprudent as a marriage between Mr wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland. 3.15076739218542
against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow Mr bingley 's carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made. 3.8298591404653206
" "their conduct has been such , " replied elizabeth , "as neither you , nor i , nor any body , can ever forget. 3.3141077532964056

they solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister. 3.426733706244092
" "but why all this secrecy ? why any fear of detection ? why must their marriage be private ? oh ! no , no , this is not likely. 3.1676936915266283
" elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances. 3.4403038559436676

" "and do you really know all this ? " cried Mrs gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive. 3.4127462204024024
miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful. 3.850086287446515
Mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride. 3.3289260560241534

" "exceed their income ! my dear Mr bennet , " cried his wife , "what are you talking of ? why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more. 3.0251828733558495
i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. 3.7840672798341917
but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be wisest ; and now , i hope you are satisfied. 3.5587923924318026
his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Mr wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited. 3.281675334096855

as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out. 3.878424279578843
" bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business. 3.4761238772013447
" "but you forget , mama , " said elizabeth , "that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs long has promised to introduce him. 3.646898374761535
"i wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer. 4.088723677751857
he was received by Mrs bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend. 3.691353520788106
his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! oh ! it must be my uncle 's doings ! generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself. 3.32031912883015
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. 3.4950795301429745
lady catherine 's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts. 3.26427849270784
the letter was to this effect : "my dear lizzy , "i wish you joy. 3.3620614396759443
" "miss eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , "despises cards. 3.347148928825624
i know your disposition , lizzy. 3.4331588092314536
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt 's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over. 3.779162061692579
" "and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " "my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle 's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour. 3.332927566797934
it was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention. 3.8057127628800878
Mr hurst looked at her with astonishment. 3.2893803210561154
"from what we have seen of him , " continued Mrs gardiner , "i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham. 3.87569224564127
my father bears it better. 3.4557798588999717
" "indeed i could not. 3.893500935089344
Mrs gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs bennet and Mrs philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces. 3.4597977079164433
" "dear lizzy ! " "oh ! you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general. 4.1284076031329136
her brother 's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. 3.7080993654497356
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but i think i may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer. 3.9394479044313213
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion. 3.8726861337313196
Mr collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. 3.0735314355740764
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! " "i am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied sir william , "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. 3.5137934540893525
he cannot afford it. 3.4094854246353092
his letter was soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution. 4.222330349143188
sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. 4.114756287591988
soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet ; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately. 3.7352725669009037
the world has been deceived in that respect ; and i am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune. 3.374022841998327
but the case is this. 3.6334892841778075
he was well , but so much engaged with Mr darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him. 4.164335076062811
bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept. 3.586026868409327
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more i think than last year. 3.3616498130773262
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers. 3.6186069239515213
she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down. 3.8395186957168814
i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. 3.431607676082636
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , i dare say. 3.0384818394685933
" jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern. 3.1919774949956707
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw. 3.165387724842596
"what an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut. 3.475657789536301

he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much ; but he saw only the father. 3.486515552228454
both changed colour , one looked white , the other red. 3.500900370118457
in a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost. 3.47053328693622
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr bennet were dead. 3.653518815071792
"they are going to be encamped near brighton ; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all. 4.121009920928739
you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and Mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. 3.750870977487349
you must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much. 3.8197827549013637

and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married. 3.309632795263882
it originated in Mrs gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth 's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband 's. 3.9642742164636573
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning ; and Mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings. 3.580105055853401
" at that moment they were met from another walk , by Mrs hurst and elizabeth herself. 3.64890829151157
elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it. 3.2089708380019974
her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture ; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness. 3.734065698422047
he carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear. 3.9509683252298173
he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. 4.069973725015581
"yes , ma 'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor. 4.149154690865652
" the introduction , however , was immediately made ; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it ; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. 4.043925133801665
"you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! unfeeling , selfish girl ! do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? " "lady catherine , i have nothing farther to say. 3.7065725286084383
my good opinion once lost is lost for ever. 2.9468681225912476
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. 3.559692028276707
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers. 3.339860357353917
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham 's departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. 3.3499278205656124
" "beyond a doubt , they do wish him to chuse miss darcy , " replied jane ; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. 3.667146089349352

wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her. 4.030565016868244
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above. 3.783688402896962

"it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , "but at the same time , Mr bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. 3.925907723167572

are you much acquainted with Mr darcy ? " "as much as i ever wish to be , " cried elizabeth warmly , - "i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable. 3.9512587769572955
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther. 4.1100474453811
" "miss elizabeth bennet ! " repeated miss bingley. 3.385896557811491

the suspicions which had just arisen of Mr darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. 3.4075745272833706
" lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , "the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. 3.3243675807949216

Mr darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! it is admirable ! " elizabeth tried to join in her father 's pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile. 3.7667028690840043
as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , "this is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of. 3.3671453135775735
Mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth , "i am glad you are come back , lizzy. 2.986070933858454

" elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved. 3.32464334895509
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship 's apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give. 3.758728564951922

" Mr darcy 's letter to lady catherine , was in a different style ; and still different from either , was what Mr bennet sent to Mr collins , in reply to his last. 3.6105221409097754
our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly. 3.5016414901460493

a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth ; but at last on Mrs bennet 's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , "oh ! that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. 3.430030449106758
"my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table. 3.452190501422799

but that gentleman , " looking at darcy , "seemed to think the country was nothing at all. 3.609524555970939
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. 3.5376658859239836

they met several times , for there was much to be discussed. 3.7527140791408122
in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off. 4.666542648027831

" as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , "i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. 4.050596486116607

Mr wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia. 3.1829246229054635
he merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention. 3.303323945073777
" lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , "i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit. 3.463502991175404
as no objection was made to the young people 's engagement with their aunt , and all Mr collins 's scruples of leaving Mr and Mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton ; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that Mr wickham had accepted their uncle 's invitation , and was then in the house. 3.8379791694567618
" "she is a very fine looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well. 3.2984517014047214
but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it. 3.9991432006865346
Mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton. 3.226603199710058
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter. 3.9844027023213924
she was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their brother 's manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness. 4.0793195221268315
" she replied in the affirmative. 3.60475992867099
"how good it was in you , my dear Mr bennet ! but i knew i should persuade you at last. 3.953378331200858

her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for Mr gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little. 3.838172495703571

Mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character. 3.47498750236115
and when i returned home , the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight 's time. 3.3548021872639717
" elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet. 2.852211667678386

his regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her deserving her mother 's reproach prevented his feeling any regret. 4.225166534499878

a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love. 3.8065697338487623

but the morrow passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son inlaw , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion. 3.6114452539861106

about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement. 3.7540774563624657

but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr darcy walk into the room. 3.4720918982696745
Mrs bennet said only , "nonsense , nonsense ! " "what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? " cried he. 3.80467908176144
i knew that Mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman. 4.026708142680744
not lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power. 3.558468232030067
do not distress me by the idea. 3.5945233112307906
* * * * * Mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. 2.9490365877060287
elizabeth 's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another. 3.139091691221072

well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done. 3.602487225989215
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Mr collins. 4.250346464942236
" "it is no such thing. 2.814224099466202
" "nor i , i am sure , " said miss bingley. 3.467620923615241
she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial. 3.928484512586549
i was uncomfortable enough. 3.146471581401899
if he had another motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him. 3.549667902283036
lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father 's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter. 4.110236540640879
you have a sweet room here , Mr bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk. 3.4917968101675663
in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam. 3.200002291583965
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society. 3.7940106748111058
"no , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night. 3.537708865586162
when the ladies returned to the drawing room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted. 3.9319447630586923

proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself. 3.842165494700174
he was resolutely silent however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , "i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , ' she a beauty ! i should as soon call her mother a wit. 3.8677639287546794
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , i shall not say nay to him ; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william 's in his regimentals. 3.304254612862699
lady catherine rose also , and they turned back. 4.183936310584786
she is grown so brown and coarse ! louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again. 3.788834793370886

her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous. 3.5368092643831095
" "you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate. 3.0850740189898844
" she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , "oh ! Mr bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar. 3.830949798163374
"how strange this is ! and for this we are to be thankful. 3.43043432823555
" "it ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason. 3.410582260980688
Mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets. 3.307702813798433
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life. 3.7040754726320197
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth 's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. 3.333403653999063
miss darcy , on her brother 's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side. 4.059420528838788
" " Mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife. 2.768750725343867
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn. 3.363264513045492
" "but consider your daughters. 3.2389146120835712
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn ; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up. 3.7700668809111697
" "certainly not ; at first. 3.226336727874741
i do not know who is good enough for him. 2.8631383281562046
i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood. 3.907947301645946
her ladyship was highly incensed. 3.376271695589466

it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast. 3.3211489579699682
they gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound. 3.788664833281756
" while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning. 3.231527789417615
after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that Mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses. 3.956536915404157
let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay. 4.165676276417163
lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband 's regiment happens to be so far off. 3.539103910731725
"he meant , i believe , " replied jane , "to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them. 3.619303461440264
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother 's indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? catherine , weak spirited , irritable , and completely under lydia 's guidance , had been always affronted by their advice ; and lydia , self willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing. 3.6221998727739804
you must learn some of my philosophy. 3.2714367938883973
" "my object then , " replied darcy , "was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past ; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. 3.8709513283789065
" miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour. 4.044287043820129
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. 3.2771647224359532
" the colour now rushed into elizabeth 's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself ; when her father continued , "you look conscious. 3.4903892439522193
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me. 3.6433976207115157
Mrs collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine 's being rather displeased by her staying at home. 3.7272811852793177
" she found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , "i think i have understood that Mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ? " "i have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future. 3.5872637722007235
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again. 3.4445128983540125
his revenge would have been complete indeed. 4.003477268158831
the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words. 3.5757470191239635
and i think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece 's. 3.3579444668972944
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance. 3.3473926495987136
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. 2.9231969099528015
lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention. 4.132454306994151
but we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride. 4.024301369681839
here , sarah , come to miss bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown. 4.077099639218164
as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. 3.470868082178729
" "your attendance upon her , has been too much for you. 3.650017287187761
however , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were. 4.640910520232858
i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point. 2.962856895794961
people did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas ; but , however , i hope it is not true. 4.827653681810429
" " Mr collins moreover adds , " "i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known. 3.4819165245727306
there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable. 3.8321910494246763
" elizabeth quietly answered "undoubtedly ; " and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family. 3.12944277479448
he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again. 4.066681033895977
"lady catherine de bourgh , " she replied , "has very lately given him a living. 3.5150923058778614
a house in town ! every thing that is charming ! three daughters married ! ten thousand a year ! oh , lord ! what will become of me. 3.1870391634031283
" elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her. 3.3478558354134154
" miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. 3.0305174543746207
Mr collins 's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs bennet. 3.341507193163276
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer. 3.679048370404623
lydia came to us ; and wickham had constant admission to the house. 4.000294763642036
if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen. 4.330868475130464
Mrs bennet 's schemes for this day were ineffectual. 3.3252212829899683
"on the evening before my going to london , " said he "i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago. 3.7375976037252165
" "true , " said Mr bennet , "but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it. 3.719562636422141
at such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented. 3.598634213492298
he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions. 4.11986032986299

" "i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object. 3.5046470732966033
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. 3.142400470403823
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within. 4.492035475537714
"do not you want to know who has taken it ? " cried his wife impatiently. 3.85702447150634
this cannot be ! engaged to Mr darcy ! no , no , you shall not deceive me. 3.7472586671841466
i knew you would be wishing me joy. 3.368343628823386
he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. 3.6341710344708615
if you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation. 3.2124942130428424
elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between Mr wickham and herself. 3.3925773170686204
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case. 3.4896251404923997
she has known him only a fortnight. 3.3267090932880508
" upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock. 3.295911287732446

the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch. 3.6879401892097827
the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte 's dying an old maid. 3.247163630591743
but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure. 3.874399230193826
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. 3.2419395156438506
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more. 3.4140761589927804
in a few minutes , Mrs bennet half opened the door and called out , "lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you. 3.443868905790479
" he then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. 4.024066724428925
you thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say. 3.5448408234679234
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. 2.784074018760154
Mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house. 3.3084506675213814
she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , "now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let Mr collins and me have a little conversation together. 4.126192959561109
Mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public. 3.453010090160625
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained. 3.8299912581912006
her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. 3.177992609398493
i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother. 3.8605743337353235
they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. 3.471360498998353
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. 3.265155353672945
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , gossiping lucases. 3.5574073369350288
" "why did not you all learn ? you ought all to have learned. 3.389931524758662
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; jane certainly could not come back. 3.2230270282262037
i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that Mr darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. 3.91759335284914
it was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit. 3.7475795563888505
" Mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters. 3.018184235472157
" "will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again ? at present i have not room to do them justice. 3.3678313471434063
to Mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough. 3.736312334375726
his reception however was of the most flattering kind. 3.8483870318813005
" "yes , madam , " said Mrs bennet , delighted to speak to a lady catherine. 3.526266693107798

elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley. 3.547760253175432
"i have no reason , i assure you , " said he , "to be dissatisfied with my reception. 3.1697994605233215
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? " elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , "you are mistaken , Mr darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner. 3.262274893742526
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. 3.789485323802653
what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received ! he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex. 3.7610017903406874
i dearly love a laugh. 3.700711914654155
"the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other. 3.6410975240077454
" "you are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body ! if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers. 3.4021224657055558
i shall offer to pay him to morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter. 4.390446621789028
- i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you. 3.679834081627708
the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn. 3.8724781828135475
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men servants go with her. 3.1815153271564593
oh ! lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall i bear so much happiness ! " she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty. 3.785064268659883
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner 's shop just over the way. 3.1696267881528257
"it is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. 3.3445379212412596
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was. 4.054305885835499
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious. 3.862838877070595
she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend. 3.5055130409378705
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london ; and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys. 3.8507375977717166
